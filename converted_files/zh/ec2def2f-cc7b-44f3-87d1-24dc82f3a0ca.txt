A. Ten basic features of Learning Chinese
 1. Provides instruction in spoken and written Mandarin; no prior background 
assumed.
 2. Serves as a comprehensive resource for the foundation levels of Chinese 
language study. Learning Chinese (ﬁ rst year) and the forthcoming compan-
ion volume (second year) cover approximately 200 class hours.
 3. Includes sample schedules for all 200 hours of class study.
 4. Presents rich content (based on the author’s own experience learning 
Chinese) that is presented incrementally and in detail, is carefully 
sequenced, and builds toward dialogues or narratives that recapitulate 
important content.
 5. Includes a variety of exercises and audio materials for self-study. The com-
panion website, yalebooks.com/wheatley, provides a full set of audio clips, as 
well as comprehensive vocabulary lists, exercise keys, and other features.
 6. Contains content that is easily transformed into class activities, and easily 
supplemented by online or other materials.
 7. Includes conversational lessons and character lessons that can be used 
separately or together.
 8. Includes conversational and character lessons that are related but not iden-
tical to each other, and which can be interleaved.
 9. Teaches reading with both the traditional (Taiwan) and simpliﬁ ed (Main-
land) character sets.
 10. Teaches characters inductively, by emphasizing reading in context as much 
as possible.

B. Ten general principles for using Learning Chinese
 1. Prepare before class, perform in class, and consolidate after class.
 2. Move from simple to complex, from familiar to novel, and from rote to 
realistic.
 3. Focus on typical interchanges, personalize them when possible, and com-
pound them into longer conversations.
 4. Recognize that Mandarin usage varies as much as English. Regard Learning 
Chinese as a guide, but accept additional input from teachers and your own 
observations.
 5. Learn functional phrases rather than individual words; visualize interac-
tions and match appropriate language; and act out scenarios from cues.
 6. Distinguish character recognition from reading, and focus reading activi-
ties on comprehension.
 7. Write characters to improve recognition ability, but utilize word processing 
programs to compose texts.

INTRODUCTION

Goals and methods
The language
This is a course in Standard Chinese, a language that is often colloquially 
referred to as Mandarin. The origins of this language and its position in the 
Chinese-speaking world will be discussed below, in the section on linguistic 
background.
Variation
Given the geographic spread of Mandarin across the Chinese-speaking world, 
and its function as a lingua franca co-existing with regional and local languages, 
it is not surprising that it demonstrates a broad range of variation in pronun-
ciation, word choice, grammar, and usage. Some speakers, by virtue of geo-
graphic origin or educational background, may claim to be arbiters of ‘good’ 
and ‘bad’ Mandarin, particularly in matters of pronunciation, where the edu-
cated speech of Beijing is generally considered to be standard. However, when 
it comes to the pronunciation of individual words, word choice, particular 
nuances of meaning, grammatical organization of sentences, or linguistic 
usage, Chinese displays a range of variation comparable to, or perhaps greater 
than, that of English, and such variation is only likely to grow as contact with 
foreigners increases and the Chinese language spreads beyond the borders of 
China.

Learning Chinese recognizes a standard sound system for Mandarin (as rep-
resented in the pinyin system of romanization) but otherwise accepts a broad 
range of usage, much of it conditioned by social or geographic factors. Where 
particular usage can be labeled (as, for example, ‘Taiwan’ or ‘southern China’), 
it is. There may also be unlabeled linguistic material in Learning Chinese that 
is judged aberrant by teachers or other native speakers of the language. Such 
judgments should be noted, but they too may need to be revised as you continue 
to observe the language in its full richness, as it is actually spoken or written.
The audience
Though students who already have some ability in Chinese will, in many cases, 
ﬁ nd this course useful, it does not assume any prior background in the lan-
guage. Learning Chinese is intended for a diverse audience, specialist and non-
specialist alike, who need a course that not only guides them toward basic 
conversational and literary skills but also stimulates their curiosity about the 
linguistic setting of the language and the geography, history, and culture of the 
lands where it is spoken. Learning Chinese is intended to provide a solid foun-
dation for further study of the language, whether in a specialized program of 
Chinese studies or in conjunction with work or further study in a Chinese-
speaking environment.
A foundation
When you begin studying a language, a lot of time has to be spent familiarizing 
yourself with the ‘code’: the sounds, words, and organization of the language. 
There comes a point, after a year or two of (non-intensive) study, when you 
have acquired a critical mass of language material and, provided you remain 
observant and responsive to feedback, can start to learn effectively from direct 
interaction with native speakers. This is also the point at which the notion of 
immersion begins to make sense, and when going abroad to study the language 
in a completely immersive setting offers the maximum beneﬁ t. This textbook 
is designed to get you to that point. With the additional materials recommended 
within, it covers approximately 200 class hours—a year and a half to two years 
in a regular course of study.

Self-instruction
With help from a Chinese speaker, particularly in the early stages of language 
development, Learning Chinese can also serve as a manual for self-instruction. 
It introduces the language systematically; it has extensive explanations about 
usage, as well as suggestions about how to learn the material within; it provides 
a pathway for the inductive learning of both conversational and literary skills; 
and it comes with a selection of audio ﬁ les and other materials that can be 
accessed electronically.
Goals summarized
Succinctly, the goals of Learning Chinese are: (a) a basic conversational compe-
tence, which means mastery of pronunciation and familiarity with a repertoire 
of useful conversational situations, including some, involving language and 
cultural issues, that allow you as a learner to explore topics of interest; (b) an 
understanding of the reading process and the properties of the character writing 
system so that you can begin to develop a reading competence by way of edited 
texts written in either the simpliﬁ ed or the traditional character set; (c) the 
ability to represent speech with the pinyin system of transcription, to write a 
selection of characters from one of the standard character sets, and to use refer-
ence materials, word processing, or other forms of electronic communication 
to continue to independently build language competence; and (d) a basic famil-
iarity with those aspects of modern Chinese society and culture that speciﬁ cally 
relate to language use.
Reaching the goals
You study a foreign language in order to learn how to converse with people of 
another culture, to read material written in the language of that culture, to be 
able to write the language down, to prepare spoken presentations, and, if you 
are very ambitious, to write letters, reports, or other forms of composition in 
that language. How should you proceed effectively to reach those goals? What 
should the focus of study be? The following is a brief attempt, in anticipation 
of a complete course of study, to answer these questions.

A. CONVERSATIONAL SKILLS When learning a foreign language, the conversa-
tional skills of listening and speaking are primary; the literary skills of reading 
and writing are secondary. In effect, conversational skills can be taught inde-
pendently of reading and writing, but the latter are most effectively taught with 
reference to spoken language.
For the oral skills of speaking and listening, the objective—learning how to 
interact in context—is clear. If a colleague pokes his head in my ofﬁ ce to ask, 
Nĭmen yŏu săn ma? (literally: ‘You-all have umbrella question’), I can interpret 
his request not as an inquiry about possessions—‘Do you own an umbrella?’—
but as a request to borrow an umbrella—‘Can you lend me an umbrella?’—
because I know it’s raining and he’s going to meet his wife. So I respond, 
without much thought: Yoˇ u, yoˇ u, yào yòng ma? ‘Sure, you want to use it?’ 
Almost before the words are out of my mouth, I realize—for various reasons 
that involve the likelihood of his making such a request—that it is more likely 
he’s asking if I need to borrow his umbrella: ‘Do you need an umbrella?’ 
Indeed, this is the case, for he then clariﬁ es: Bù, bù, woˇ  pà nıˇ men méiyoˇ u ‘No, 
I was afraid you [all] didn’t have one.’
This example underscores the importance of situational context. Ultimately, 
it was context that led me to an interpretation of the speaker’s intentions. It 
was also context that allowed me to ﬁ gure out that ‘You-all have umbrella ques-
tion’ meant ‘Do you need an umbrella?’ For the learner, the situational context 
is clearest during personal interactions; in other words, in conversation. Learn-
ing Chinese focuses on conversation from the start, with you, the learner, as a 
participant as much as possible. Conversation also involves instant feedback 
and a degree of overlapping content, so that listening skills support speaking 
and vice versa.
In Learning Chinese, content is organized into units of a dozen or more topics, 
each of which takes several weeks to complete. You will proceed as if on a

A. CONVERSATIONAL SKILLS When learning a foreign language, the conversa-
tional skills of listening and speaking are primary; the literary skills of reading 
and writing are secondary. In effect, conversational skills can be taught inde-
pendently of reading and writing, but the latter are most effectively taught with 
reference to spoken language.
For the oral skills of speaking and listening, the objective—learning how to 
interact in context—is clear. If a colleague pokes his head in my ofﬁ ce to ask, 
Nĭmen yŏu săn ma? (literally: ‘You-all have umbrella question’), I can interpret 
his request not as an inquiry about possessions—‘Do you own an umbrella?’—
but as a request to borrow an umbrella—‘Can you lend me an umbrella?’—
because I know it’s raining and he’s going to meet his wife. So I respond, 
without much thought: Yoˇ u, yoˇ u, yào yòng ma? ‘Sure, you want to use it?’ 
Almost before the words are out of my mouth, I realize—for various reasons 
that involve the likelihood of his making such a request—that it is more likely 
he’s asking if I need to borrow his umbrella: ‘Do you need an umbrella?’ 
Indeed, this is the case, for he then clariﬁ es: Bù, bù, woˇ  pà nıˇ men méiyoˇ u ‘No, 
I was afraid you [all] didn’t have one.’
This example underscores the importance of situational context. Ultimately, 
it was context that led me to an interpretation of the speaker’s intentions. It 
was also context that allowed me to ﬁ gure out that ‘You-all have umbrella ques-
tion’ meant ‘Do you need an umbrella?’ For the learner, the situational context 
is clearest during personal interactions; in other words, in conversation. Learn-
ing Chinese focuses on conversation from the start, with you, the learner, as a 
participant as much as possible. Conversation also involves instant feedback 
and a degree of overlapping content, so that listening skills support speaking 
and vice versa.
In Learning Chinese, content is organized into units of a dozen or more topics, 
each of which takes several weeks to complete. You will proceed as if on a 
guided tour, being introduced to relevant material, practicing short interac-
tions, proceeding in overlapping waves, and culminating in one or more exten-
sive dialogues that knit the various parts of the unit into a cohesive whole. This 
approach makes it possible to introduce a wealth of interconnected material 
that can form the basis of engaging conversations and interesting narratives.

For example, Unit 4 presents (among other things) time phrases, names and 
titles, introductions, and subjects of study. These can be practiced piecemeal 
during introductory classes; later, they are woven into a dialogue involving a 
Chinese businessman striking up a conversation with an overseas student 
(such as yourself) on a bus in Sichuan province. Within each lesson, topics are 
selected so you can build up a conversational repertoire that can be personal-
ized, practiced, and extended from lesson to lesson.
B. READING AND CHARACTERS During conversation, you are trying to apprehend 
the intentions of the speaker; so, too, in reading, you are trying to interpret the 
intentions of the author, who had to imagine an audience and transform the 
language into written code. In English, the written code is based on letters and 
various grammatical conventions; in Chinese, it is based on characters and a 
different set of grammatical conventions.
For the literate, reading Chinese feels like a seamless process of extracting 
meaning from text: characters evoke words (or parts of words) and words 
evoke images that blend into meanings. However, when you are learning 
to read a language like Chinese, the reading process tends to resolve itself 
into two phases: recognizing the characters (which is actually a process 
of matching ‘single-syllable’ characters to what are often polysyllabic 
words) and then reading for comprehension. Because learning to recognize 
characters is so difﬁ cult, the problems of comprehension (over and above 
basic recognition of characters) sometimes receive less attention than 
they deserve.
The character units in Learning Chinese are intended to address both issues. 
To ease the burden of learning to recognize characters, the texts are composed 
of words and grammatical patterns that are familiar from the core units; the 
texts are also composed so that new characters appear with enough frequency, 
and in a sufﬁ cient range of contexts, to make it possible to retain and recall 
them through the process of reading alone. In addition, to ensure that reading 
proceeds smoothly from character recognition to comprehension, most of the 
readings are embedded in question-and-answer or comment-and-response 
formats that provide clear contexts for understanding.

The goal of the reading instruction in Learning Chinese is to foster an under-
standing of the reading process and develop basic reading skills in students 
with little or no prior experience in Chinese so that they may make the transi-
tion to graded reading materials already in print, beginning with such well-
tested classics as The Lady in the Painting and Strange Tales in a Chinese Studio 
(both published by Yale University Press).
C. COMPOSITION Of the four essential language skills—listening, speaking, 
reading, and writing–the last (better called ‘composition’) is the most elusive, 
and after years of schooling, even native speakers often ﬁ nd written expression 
difﬁ cult. The problem stems from the lack of the sort of feedback that guides 
face-to-face interaction; not just linguistic features like stress and intonation, 
but facial expressions, gestural movements, and the physical context of the 
interaction, all of which help to monitor the communicative event. However, 
because writing persists, the good writer learns to tailor it to an imagined audi-
ence, providing more redundancy in the form of complete sentences, precise 
usage, and elaboration. This careful tailoring often depends on language intu-
ition that only native speakers possess, and even the most ﬂ uent speakers of a 
learned language usually depend on native speakers to verify the accuracy of 
written work.
While learning to write well enough to serve even basic needs of written 
communication is a skill best left to higher levels of language learning, when 
conversational and reading skills are more advanced, composition can serve a 
useful purpose even at foundation levels. Because it is a productive skill, like 
speaking, composition can help with vocabulary growth, usage, grammar, and 
cohesion. In later units, Learning Chinese occasionally makes use of ‘guided 
compositions’, in which an outline of the content is given and the task is to 
incorporate it into a written text. Teachers may wish to add other written assign-
ments, in the form of diary entries, biographical sketches, or personal letters 
(such as the one that appears in Unit 7).

other spoken material using characters. Dramatic plays and the dialogue sec-
tions of novels and language textbooks are among the genres that record 
spoken language in this way. However, as you know, while the Chinese script 
is an efﬁ cient and aesthetically pleasing writing system for native speakers of 
the language, it has disadvantages for learners who need a way of representing 
pronunciation and keeping track of language material during the learning 
process. Learning Chinese separates the study of the language in general from 
the study of characters in particular. Conversational material is presented in 
the standard, phonetically based notation of the Chinese-speaking world, called 
Hanyu Pinyin, ‘spelling the sounds of Chinese’. Utilizing Hanyu Pinyin for 
the core units ensures that the learning of spoken material is not conditioned 
by factors related to character acquisition; in effect, it means that dialogues and 
other spoken material can be more natural and extensive than would be pos-
sible if all the characters that represent them had to be learned at the same 
time.
Because Learning Chinese separates character reading (and writing) from 
other aspects of language learning, students who wish to study or review the 
spoken language without reference to characters can ignore, or postpone, the 
character units, while those with sufﬁ cient vocabulary and grammatical knowl-
edge can alternatively study the character material alone.
Writing of characters
While learning to write, or reproduce characters, does help with recognition 
(and so, ultimately, with reading), it is not the case that you need to be able to 
write all characters from memory in order to be able to read them. A hint or 
two—the ‘heart’ sign in one character, a ‘phonetic’ element in another—will 
often be enough for the expectations arising from context to be conﬁ rmed. In 
recognition of this, the character material in Learning Chinese is organized 
primarily to develop reading skills. Information on how to write the graphs is 
included to draw attention to the general structure of characters, as well as to 
facilitate their reproduction. It is certainly useful to learn to write from memory 
a few hundred of the more common characters in order to absorb the general 
principles of character construction. It is also useful to be able to write personal 
information in characters so that you can sign in and sign out, ﬁ ll out forms,

and jot down your contact information. Otherwise, like most Chinese them-
selves nowadays, the bulk of your writing will make use of Chinese language 
word processing, which involves selecting from a set of character options—in 
other words, character recognition, not production. Thus, Learning Chinese 
takes the position that learning to write characters from memory is not a 
primary goal at foundation levels.
The simpliﬁ ed and traditional character sets
Without the requirement that characters be written from memory, the exis-
tence of two sets of Chinese characters (the simpliﬁ ed set used on the Mainland 
and in Singapore, and the traditional set associated with Taiwan and many 
overseas communities) becomes much less problematical. Both sets can be 
introduced simultaneously. Students note the relationship between the two 
forms, learn to read both in context (though Learning Chinese places more 
emphasis on the simpliﬁ ed set), and select one to write. We recommend fol-
lowing the Mainland majority and learning to write the simpliﬁ ed set, which 
is generally based on well-established written variants. Individuals are free to 
choose, but should be aware that while formal examinations tend to offer ver-
sions of both, Mainland study programs expect their students to be able to read 
simpliﬁ ed characters.
From textbook to classroom
The selection and ordering of topics in Learning Chinese is based on my own 
experience learning and teaching Chinese over several decades. It is guided by 
what the beginning student is likely to encounter in and out of the classroom 
setting, as well as by the need to provide a broad foundation of grammatical, 
lexical, and cultural information for future work in Chinese. It mixes practical 
topics, such as providing biographical information, buying train tickets, or 
giving toasts, with topics of general interest, such as geography, regional lan-
guages (‘dialects’), and brand names. Such topics are easily enriched with 
online materials such as satellite maps, photographs, video clips, and advertise-
ments. They are also easy to transform into effective classroom activities.

The language learner as explorer
It is my belief that, given the enormity of the task of learning a new language 
(which I sometimes liken to repairing a car while driving it, or renovating your 
house while still living in it), it is helpful to be as interested in the new language 
as it is to be fascinated by the new culture—of which language is a part. Unfor-
tunately, writing about language tends to be dry and unnecessarily technical. 
Until now, there has been no ‘Indiana Jones’ for linguists. In Learning Chinese, 
we have not only made the language the focus of some conversations and nar-
ratives, but we have also frequently gone out of the way to comment on the 
history, structure, and delightful quirks that are scattered across the linguistic 
terrain. In my own experience, one of the main topics of conversation with 
Chinese friends all over the world has been the language itself, whether it be 
regional accents, local usage, or the Chinese equivalent of ‘splat’. (Which is, 
incidentally, biā, a sound for which, ofﬁ cially at least, there is no character.) 
The other two common subjects of conversation are weather and, as you might 
expect, food; therefore, these two topics are also given some prominence in 
Learning Chinese.
Learning Chinese is exuberant rather than restrained. Its Chinese content is 
current and lively, with subjects that range from ordering food to bargaining, 
from religion to the Chinese school system. It is also larded with quotations, 
rhymes, popular culture, linguistic information, and historical and geographi-
cal notes. It is intended to be an intellectually stimulating resource for both 
students and teachers alike.

Names for China
The immediate source of the name ‘China’ is thought to be a Persian word1, 
which appeared in European languages during the 16th or 17th century as a 
name for porcelain, that was then applied to the country from which the ﬁ nest 
examples of that material came. If this is correct, then ‘China’ derives from 
‘china’, not the other way around.

island of Taiwan, clusters of islands in the Taiwan Straits, the ‘offshore islands’ 
of Quemoy (Jīnmén) and Matsu (Maˇ zuˇ ) close to the mainland, and some minor 
islands in the South China Sea and to the east of Taiwan. In recent years, even 
in formal contexts (such as on recent postage stamps), ‘Taiwan’ sometimes 
takes the place of ‘Republic of China’ as a name for the political entity.
Taiwan–Táiwān
Taiwan is some 210 kilometers off the coast of eastern China’s Fujian province; 
its central mountains are just visible from the Fujian coast on a clear day. The 
Dutch colonized the island in the early 17th century, ﬁ ghting off the Spanish, 
who had also established bases on the northern part of the island. The Dutch 
called the island Formosa, from the name Ilha Formosa ‘beautiful island’, given 
to it earlier by the Portuguese (who did not actually colonize it).
Taiwan’s earliest inhabitants spoke Austronesian languages unrelated to 
Chinese, and indigenous groups such as the Ami, Paiwan, and Bunan (who 
still speak non-Chinese languages) are descendents of those early Taiwan 
Austronesians. By the 13th century, Chinese speaking Hakka and Fukienese—
regional Chinese languages—had established small communities on the island. 
These were joined by refugees from the Ming after the fall of that dynasty on 
the mainland. The Qing dynasty annexed Taiwan in 1683, making it a province. 
In 1895, Taiwan, along with nearby islands such as the Pescadores group 
(Pénghú Lièdaˇo), was ceded to Japan as part of the settlement of the Sino-Jap-
anese war. It remained a Japanese colony until 1945, when it was returned to 
the Republic of China.
Under the Nationalist government, Mandarin (Guóyuˇ ) was made the ofﬁ cial 
language of the country, while Taiwanese (Táiyuˇ ), a form of Southern Min 
spoken by the majority of its population, was suppressed. In recent years, 
however, Taiwanese has undergone a resurgence in public life.
Hong Kong—Xiāng Gaˇ ng
Hong Kong lies within the Cantonese-speaking region of southern China. The 
English name derives from the Cantonese pronunciation of the place, ‘Heung 
Gong’, which means ‘fragrant harbor’ (Xiāng Gaˇ ng in Mandarin). Hong Kong

island of Taiwan, clusters of islands in the Taiwan Straits, the ‘offshore islands’ 
of Quemoy (Jīnmén) and Matsu (Maˇ zuˇ ) close to the mainland, and some minor 
islands in the South China Sea and to the east of Taiwan. In recent years, even 
in formal contexts (such as on recent postage stamps), ‘Taiwan’ sometimes 
takes the place of ‘Republic of China’ as a name for the political entity.
Taiwan–Táiwān
Taiwan is some 210 kilometers off the coast of eastern China’s Fujian province; 
its central mountains are just visible from the Fujian coast on a clear day. The 
Dutch colonized the island in the early 17th century, ﬁ ghting off the Spanish, 
who had also established bases on the northern part of the island. The Dutch 
called the island Formosa, from the name Ilha Formosa ‘beautiful island’, given 
to it earlier by the Portuguese (who did not actually colonize it).
Taiwan’s earliest inhabitants spoke Austronesian languages unrelated to 
Chinese, and indigenous groups such as the Ami, Paiwan, and Bunan (who 
still speak non-Chinese languages) are descendents of those early Taiwan 
Austronesians. By the 13th century, Chinese speaking Hakka and Fukienese—
regional Chinese languages—had established small communities on the island. 
These were joined by refugees from the Ming after the fall of that dynasty on 
the mainland. The Qing dynasty annexed Taiwan in 1683, making it a province. 
In 1895, Taiwan, along with nearby islands such as the Pescadores group 
(Pénghú Lièdaˇo), was ceded to Japan as part of the settlement of the Sino-Jap-
anese war. It remained a Japanese colony until 1945, when it was returned to 
the Republic of China.
Under the Nationalist government, Mandarin (Guóyuˇ ) was made the ofﬁ cial 
language of the country, while Taiwanese (Táiyuˇ ), a form of Southern Min 
spoken by the majority of its population, was suppressed. In recent years, 
however, Taiwanese has undergone a resurgence in public life.
Hong Kong—Xiāng Gaˇ ng
Hong Kong lies within the Cantonese-speaking region of southern China. The 
English name derives from the Cantonese pronunciation of the place, ‘Heung 
Gong’, which means ‘fragrant harbor’ (Xiāng Gaˇ ng in Mandarin). Hong Kong

was formally ceded to the British in the Treaty of Nanking (Nánjīng), which 
was signed at the end of the Opium War in 1842 on a ship anchored in the 
Yangtze River, slightly to the east of Nanjing. The Kowloon Peninsula (Jiuˇ lóng 
‘nine dragons’) was added in 1860 after the Second Opium War, and the New 
Territories (Xīnjiè), which includes islands and mainland territory, were leased 
to the British in 1898 for 99 years, making Hong Kong total slightly more than 
1,000 square kilometers.
In 1984, well before the expiration of the New Territories lease, Prime Min-
ister Margaret Thatcher and Chairman Deng Xiaoping formulated the Sino-
British Joint Declaration, an agreement for the return of Hong Kong to Chinese 
sovereignty. In 1990, the principle of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ [Yī Guó, 
Liaˇ ng Zhì] was formulated: Hong Kong would retain its laws and a high degree 
of political autonomy for 50 years. At midnight on July 1, 1997, Hong Kong 
became a Special Administrative Region [Tèbié Xíngzhèngqū] of China, which 
guaranteed it autonomy within the PRC in all but foreign affairs and defense.
Historically, Hong Kong has been settled by a number of distinct Chinese 
groups. These include the Bendi (‘locals’), who emigrated during the Song 
dynasty (10th–13th century) after being driven from their homes in north 
China; the Tanka, ﬁ sherfolk who lived on boats and are thought by some to be 
the descendents of the non-Han Yue people; the Hokla, early immigrants from 
Fujian; the Hakka, who ended up mostly in less fertile parts of the New Ter-
ritories; and numerous clans and people from nearby Cantonese-speaking 
regions, as well as other parts of China. Despite its small size, Hong Kong has 
more successfully preserved the traces of many traditional Chinese social forms 
and practices than have many other parts of the Chinese-speaking world.
Macau—Àomén
Sixty kilometers to the west of Hong Kong, across the Pearl River estuary, is 
Àomén, known in English as Macau. The Chinese and English names have 
different sources. Àomén, means, literally, ‘gate to the inlet’; but the Portuguese 
name, ‘Macao’ (English Macau), is said to derive from the name of a revered 
local temple, called ‘Maagok’ in Cantonese (Māgé), dedicated to Matsu, a 
goddess worshipped by ﬁ shermen and sailors2.

The peninsula of Macau was settled by the Portuguese in 1557, and was 
administered by them for over 400 years, though the question of who held 
sovereignty was not resolved3 until 1999, when it reverted completely to Chinese 
territory. The two small islands of Coloane and Taipa were added to the terri-
tory in the middle of the 19th century, and later connected to the Macau pen-
insula by bridges. Recently, the islands have been joined by landﬁ ll, and the 
central portion has become the site of the Cotai Strip, envisioned as an Asian 
version of the Las Vegas strip—only larger. Macau is the only place in China 
where gambling is legal.
Chinese lands; Chinese overseas
Informally, the two Chinese political entities are often referred to as Mainland 
China (Zhōngguó Dàlù)—or simply ‘the Mainland’—and Taiwan, rather than 
the PRC and the ROC. The occasional need to talk about a single Chinese entity, 
consisting of the Chinese mainland plus Hong Kong and Taiwan, has recently 
given rise to a term, Liaˇ ng’àn Sāndì (‘two-shores three-lands’).
Chinese who live outside the Liaˇ ng’àn Sāndì can be classiﬁ ed as Huáqiáo, 
generally translated as ‘Overseas Chinese’. In its broadest sense, Huáqiáo can 
apply simply to ethnic Chinese living outside the Liaˇ ng’àn Sāndì, regardless of 
how assimilated they are to local cultures. More typically, however, it has a 
narrower application, referring to Chinese who retain features of Chinese 
culture in their adopted homelands and who keep ties with the motherland. 
There is another term, Huáyì (‘Chinese-hem [of a robe]; frontier’) that is applied 
to ethnic Chinese born overseas, e.g., Meˇ iguó Huáyì ‘Chinese Americans’, etc.
Nationalists and Communists
After the establishment of the PRC in 1949, it was customary to distinguish 
the two political entities by their only extant political parties, the Communist 
Party (Gòngchaˇ ndaˇ ng), abbreviated CCP, and the Nationalist Party (Guómíndaˇ ng, 
or Kuomintang), the KMT. Hence, ‘the Communist government’, ‘the Nation-
alist leaders’, etc. Recent changes in Taiwan and on the Mainland make neither 
term appropriate. In 2000, the Nationalists lost to Chen Shui-bian and the 
Democratic Progressive Party, though they returned to power in 2008 with the

the 15th century. Ofﬁ cially, the Nationalists retained the name Beˇ ipíng even 
after the Japanese conquered the city of Nanjing, and continued to do so after 
Beijing reverted to the capital in 1949 under the PRC.
The spelling ‘Peking’ is probably a reﬂ ection of the Cantonese pronunciation 
of the name Beijing, in which the initial of the second syllable is pronounced 
with a hard ‘k’ sound. Representations of Cantonese pronunciation were often 
adopted by the British as ofﬁ cial postal spellings (cf. Nanking for Nánjīng and 
Chungking for Chóngqìng). Though most foreigners now spell the name of the 
city, in Mandarin pinyin transcription, as Beijing, the old spelling and pronun-
ciation survive to this day in certain proper names, such as Peking University 
(still the ofﬁ cial English name of the institution) and Peking duck. The tran-
scription, Beijing, is not without its problems either, since speakers who do 
not know the pinyin system tend to make the ‘j’ sound more foreign or exotic 
by giving it a French quality: [bay-zhing]. As you will soon learn, the actual 
standard pronunciation is closer to [bay-džing].
Linguistic background
Chinese
One of the consequences of the long duration of Chinese history is that the 
term ‘Chinese’ has come to have a wide range of applications. It can refer to 
the earliest records, written on oracle bones, and dated to the second millen-
nium BCE. It can refer to the languages in the Sinitic branch—the ‘Sino’ of the 
Sino-Tibetan family—which includes not only the standard language but 
regional languages (‘dialects’) such as Cantonese and Hokkien. (In this sense, 
Chinese is to the modern Chinese languages as Romance is to the modern 
Latin languages French, Spanish, Italian, and so on.) Finally, in its most narrow 
sense, it can refer to the modern standard language, often called Mandarin by 
English speakers.

to Portuguese from Indian and other sources) to refer to Chinese ofﬁ cials; 
hence modern meanings such as ‘powerful ofﬁ cial; member of a powerful 
group’. They also used it for the language spoken by such ofﬁ cials, called 
Guānhuà in Chinese, ‘the speech of ofﬁ cials’. Guānhuà was the name given to 
specialized speaking practices, based on northern Chinese, which served as a 
lingua franca among ofﬁ cials and members of other educated classes who 
might come from different parts of China and speak mutually unintelligible 
Chinese in their home regions.
Guānhuà can be regarded as the precursor of the modern standard language. 
In English, the name ‘Mandarin’ has survived the transformation from special-
ized language to the modern standard, but the name Guānhuà has not. The 
Chinese term only survives in the specialized terminology of linguists, who use 
the term Beˇ ifāng Guānhuà Tıˇ xì ‘northern Guanhua system [of dialects]’ to refer 
to the northern dialect grouping that includes Mandarin and other distinct 
dialects now spoken over a vast stretch of territory in the north, west, 
and southwest of China. Western linguists often refer to this grouping as the 
Mandarin dialects, using ‘Mandarin’ in a generic sense. The Mandarin dialects 
stand in contrast to other dialect groupings, such as the Cantonese or 
Fujianese.
Strange as it may seem, the Chinese-speaking world has no single term for 
modern standard Chinese, or Mandarin. In the PRC, it is ofﬁ cially called 
Puˇ tōnghuà (‘the common language’), a term with a legacy dating back to 
the early part of the 20th century; in Taiwan, it is called Guóyuˇ  (‘the 
national language’), a term dating to at least 1918; while in Singapore, it is 
called Huáyuˇ  (‘the language of the Huá’)—Huá being an ancient name for the 
Chinese people. In ordinary speech, other terms are often used: Hànyuˇ  (‘lan-
guage of the Han’), for example, or Zhōngwén (‘Chinese-language’).
Mainlanders tend to ﬁ nd it strange that English speakers refer to the stan-
dard language as Mandarin. Norman (1988: 136) recommends using the term 
Standard Chinese or, when possible, just Chinese, and keeping Mandarin for 
the dialect grouping. In certain contexts, Chinese will sufﬁ ce, but at times it 
will be ambiguous, for it does not rule out Cantonese, Shanghainese, and other 
so-called ‘dialects’. The longer term, Standard Chinese, is awkward, and assumes

Guānhuà can be regarded as the precursor of the modern standard language. 
In English, the name ‘Mandarin’ has survived the transformation from special-
ized language to the modern standard, but the name Guānhuà has not. The 
Chinese term only survives in the specialized terminology of linguists, who use 
the term Beˇ ifāng Guānhuà Tıˇ xì ‘northern Guanhua system [of dialects]’ to refer 
to the northern dialect grouping that includes Mandarin and other distinct 
dialects now spoken over a vast stretch of territory in the north, west, 
and southwest of China. Western linguists often refer to this grouping as the 
Mandarin dialects, using ‘Mandarin’ in a generic sense. The Mandarin dialects 
stand in contrast to other dialect groupings, such as the Cantonese or 
Fujianese.
Strange as it may seem, the Chinese-speaking world has no single term for 
modern standard Chinese, or Mandarin. In the PRC, it is ofﬁ cially called 
Puˇ tōnghuà (‘the common language’), a term with a legacy dating back to 
the early part of the 20th century; in Taiwan, it is called Guóyuˇ  (‘the 
national language’), a term dating to at least 1918; while in Singapore, it is 
called Huáyuˇ  (‘the language of the Huá’)—Huá being an ancient name for the 
Chinese people. In ordinary speech, other terms are often used: Hànyuˇ  (‘lan-
guage of the Han’), for example, or Zhōngwén (‘Chinese-language’).
Mainlanders tend to ﬁ nd it strange that English speakers refer to the stan-
dard language as Mandarin. Norman (1988: 136) recommends using the term 
Standard Chinese or, when possible, just Chinese, and keeping Mandarin for 
the dialect grouping. In certain contexts, Chinese will sufﬁ ce, but at times it 
will be ambiguous, for it does not rule out Cantonese, Shanghainese, and other 
so-called ‘dialects’. The longer term, Standard Chinese, is awkward, and assumes

that there is only one standard, which makes it difﬁ cult to talk about differences 
in, say, Taiwan and Mainland Mandarin. So, in Learning Chinese, if the simple 
term ‘Chinese’ is not sufﬁ cient, we fall back on the venerable term ‘Mandarin’, 
taking heart from the usage of such eminent Chinese as Yuen Ren Chao, who 
wrote a much-loved textbook called Mandarin Primer (1948), and more recently, 
Singapore’s Lee Kwan Yew, who wrote a volume describing his own study 
called Keeping My Mandarin Alive (2005).
The origins of spoken Mandarin
Historically, a majority of the Chinese population spoke regional or local lan-
guages and was illiterate. For them, there was no general medium of commu-
nication across regional lines. For the educated, Guānhuà served in a limited 
way as a spoken medium, while Classical Chinese, the language of administra-
tion, education, and high culture (see below), served as a written medium. By 
the 19th century, it was clear that the lack of a spoken norm that could serve 
the communicative needs of all classes across the country was a major obstacle 
to the modernization of China, and eventually efforts were made to identify a 
suitable medium and promote it as the standard. Guānhuà was an obvious 
candidate. However, by the 19th century, it had become strongly associated 
with the educated speech of Beijing, putting southerners at a disadvantage. 
Classical Chinese, though it had no regional bias, was a highly stylized written 
language with ancient roots that made it an unsuitable basis for a national 
spoken medium.
After various interesting, but completely impractical, attempts to establish a 
hybrid language to balance regional differences (particularly between north and 
south) the Chinese language planners settled on a northern strategy: promoting 
the pronunciation of the educated speech of the capital, Beijing, but incorporat-
ing material from a broad range of other sources as the basis of usage. Thus, 
words with wide distribution were adopted over northern or Beijing localisms, 
for example. The spoken standard also absorbed material from written sources 
that introduced words and phrasing from the important economic and cultural 
region of the Lower Yangtze Valley (Shànghaˇ i to Nánjīng) as well as words for 
modern concepts ﬁ rst coined in Japanese.

Norms and variation
Though both Taiwan and the PRC have always agreed on the educated Beijing 
standard for pronunciation, geographical distance, political separation, and 
cultural divergence have resulted in the emergence of two norms for spoken 
usage, as a comparison of dictionaries from Taiwan and the PRC will demon-
strate. These differences, though still moderate in scope, extend from the pro-
nunciation of particular words to grammar and usage.
Even within the emerging norms of Standard Chinese (Mainland and Taiwan 
versions), enormous variety exists at the local level. The case of Taiwan is illus-
trative. There, Guóyuˇ  (Mandarin) is not the ﬁ rst language of much of the popu-
lation. The most common ﬁ rst language is Táiyuˇ  (Taiwanese), a Southern Min 
language that is very similar to the Southern Min spoken in the province of 
Fujian across the Taiwan Straits. (Until the success of the ‘Speak Mandarin’ 
movement, Southern Min was also the language of most Singapore Chinese; 
elsewhere in Southeast Asia, it remains an important language in Chinese 
communities.)
With so many in Taiwan speaking Táiyuˇ  as a ﬁ rst language, it is not surpris-
ing that the Mandarin spoken there is often inﬂ uenced by the pronunciation, 
grammar, and usage of Taiwanese. The result is a unique Taiwanese Mandarin. 
The same phenomenon occurs elsewhere, of course, so that no matter where 
you are in China, Mandarin heard on the street will generally have local fea-
tures. Native speakers quickly get used to these differences, just as English 
speakers get used to regional accents of English. Learners will typically ﬁ nd the 
variation disruptive, and they will need time and experience to adjust to it.
Though there are probably more and more Chinese who speak some variety 
of Mandarin as their ﬁ rst language, and whose speech is close to the appointed 
norms, it is still true that the majority of Chinese speak more than one variety 
of Chinese, and for many of them the standard speech represented in this 
textbook would be a second language. A few years ago, USA Today published 
statistics on the ‘world’s most common languages, ranked by population that 
uses each as a ﬁ rst language’. Mandarin was listed ﬁ rst, with 885 million speak-
ers (followed by Spanish with 332 million and English with 322 million). The

other regional languages, but it must include a large number of speakers whose 
Chinese would be difﬁ cult to understand by someone familiar only with the 
Beijing standard.
When describing the best Chinese language, Chinese speakers tend to focus 
on pronunciation, praising it as biāozhuˇ n ‘standard’. For this reason, native 
Chinese speakers, who tend to be effusive in their praise in any case, will some-
times ﬂ atter a foreigner by saying he or she speaks the language better than 
they do. By ‘better’, they mean with a better approximation to the standard, 
educated accent. Apart from language classrooms, the most biāozhuˇ n Mandarin 
is heard on the broadcast media, in schools, and in the speech of young, 
educated urban Chinese.
Regional languages and minority languages
There are seven major dialect groupings of Chinese, including the geographi-
cally extensive Mandarin group (divided into southwestern, northwestern, and 
northern regions) mentioned earlier. Of the others, Cantonese (Yuè), Shang-
hainese (Wú), Fukienese or Hokkien (Mıˇ n), and Hakka (Kèjiā) are the best 
known. (Yuè, Wú, and Mıˇ n are Chinese linguistic designations, while Hokkien 
and Hakka are the regional pronunciations of the names Fújiàn and Kèjiā, 
respectively.) All represent groupings of diverse dialects thought to share a 
common origin. Even within each group, the varieties are not necessarily mutu-
ally intelligible. Cantonese, for example, includes dialects such as Hoisan 
(Táishān) which are quite distinct from the standard dialect.
In many respects, the dialect groupings of Chinese—represented by Canton-
ese, Shanghainese, Hakka, etc.—are different languages. They are not, after 
all, mutually intelligible, and they have their own standard speeches (Guang-
zhou for Cantonese, Suzhou for Shanghainese, etc.). In linguistic terms, they 
are often said to be comparable to Dutch and German or Spanish and Portu-
guese. However, unlike those European languages, the Chinese ‘dialects’ share 
a written language and identify with a common culture. Recently, the term 
‘topolect’, a direct translation with Greek roots of the Chinese term fāngyán 
(‘place-language’), has gained currency as a more formal term for what are 
generally called ‘regional languages’ in this book. So we may speak of Canton-

Regional languages should be distinguished from the languages of the non-

speaking Cantonese-ﬂ avored Mandarin in certain formal or ofﬁ cial situations,

and usage from both Taishan and standard Cantonese. Even though he or she 
would read it aloud with Cantonese pronunciation, it would in fact be more 
easily relatable to Mandarin in lexicon, grammar, and in all respects other than 
pronunciation.
From Classical Chinese to modern written Chinese
Written language always differs from spoken, for it serves quite different func-
tions. In the case of Chinese, the difference was, until the early part of the 20th 
century, extreme. Until then, most written communication, and almost all 
printed matter, was written in a language called Wényán ‘literary language’, 
and generally known in English as Classical Chinese. As noted earlier, it was 
this language that served as a medium of written communication for the liter-
ate classes, much as Latin served as a medium for communication among 
educated classes in medieval Europe.
Classical Chinese was unlikely ever to have been a close representation of a 
spoken language. It is thought to have had its roots in the language spoken 
some 2,500 years ago in northern China. That language, though still Chinese 
in the sense that it is ancestral to modern Chinese languages, would have dif-
fered quite signiﬁ cantly in sound, grammar, and vocabulary from any form of 
modern Chinese. Though Classical Chinese can be regarded as a different 
language from the modern, it was written in characters that have retained their 
basic shape to the present day, and these serve to preserve the connection 
between ancient and modern words whose pronunciation and grammatical 
context is radically different. While spelling differences (that reﬂ ect changes in 
pronunciation), as well a high degree of word replacement, make Old English 
texts almost completely opaque to modern readers, ancient Chinese texts con-
tinue to look familiar to Chinese readers despite the changes that have taken 
place in the intervening years. Educated Chinese can read them aloud in 
modern standard pronunciation, say, or in Cantonese or Hokkien. Without 
knowledge of the grammar and vocabulary of Classical Chinese, they may not 
fully understand them, but enough words—and, indeed, sayings and phrases—

Classical Chinese is still used for certain kinds of formal or ritual writing,

even style for the modern language, both written and spoken, but relatively few 
people read the classical language well, and only a few specialists are still able 
to write it ﬂ uently.
Since Classical Chinese was not based on an accessible spoken language, 
facility in composition required memorizing large samples to act as models. 
Once learned, the classical language would tend to channel expression in con-
servative directions. Citation was the main form of argument; balance and 
euphony were crucial elements of style. These features did not endear it to the

spoken version. They had a precedent, for all through Chinese history 
there had in fact been genres of writing known as Báihuà (‘white—plain or 
vernacular—language’) that were rich in colloquial elements. Such genres were 
not highly regarded or considered worthy of being literary models, but they 
were well known as the medium of the popular Ming and Qing novels, such 
as Dream of the Red Chamber (also called the The Story of Stone), Journey to the 
West (also known as Monkey King), or the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. 
Though it retained classical elements, Báihuà provided the early model for a 
more colloquial standard written language.
Because norms within the newly emerging written language varied, and led 
to problems of consistency and clarity, some advocated a return to Classical 
Chinese as the written standard. If it could have shed some of its stylistic affec-
tations (such as the high value put on elaborate or archaic diction), Classical 
Chinese might have developed into a modern written norm much as Classical 
Arabic has become the written norm of the Arabic-speaking world. Classical

Taiwan and the PRC diverged. In the PRC, political and other factors favored

Characters
The earliest extensive examples of written Chinese date from late in the second 
millennium BCE. These are the so-called oracle bone inscriptions (jiaˇ guˇ wén), 
inscribed or painted on ox bones and the bottom plate (the carapace) of tortoise 
shells. This early writing made use of characters whose forms differed in 
appearance but can still be directly related to modern characters. During the 
Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), the script was modiﬁ ed and standardized as part 
of the reform of government administration. The resulting style, known as the 
‘little seal’ (xiaˇ o zhuàn), is still used on ofﬁ cial seals (or ‘chops’). At ﬁ rst glance, 
little seal characters look quite unlike the modern versions, but a native reader 
can often discern the correspondences.
A script known as lìshū came into extensive use during the Han dynasty (202 
BCE–220 CE). Individual strokes in the lìshū style are described as having a 
‘silkworm’s head and swallow’s tail’. It is still used occasionally for writing large 
characters. The modern script, the kind generally used for printed matter, is 
based on the kaˇ ishū ‘model script’ that has been in use since before the period 
known as the Southern and Northern Dynasties (5th and 6th centuries). Other 
varieties of script were developed for handwriting (xíngshū ‘running script’) and 
calligraphy (caˇ oshū ‘grass script’). Illustrations of the development of Chinese 
script can be found at websites such as Simon Ager’s ‘Omniglot’: www.

Traditional and simpliﬁ ed characters
In the past, simpler and more complex versions of characters have often coex-

dence, and the simpler were used for personal communications. In the 1950s,

script can be found at websites such as Simon Ager’s ‘Omniglot’: www.

Traditional and simpliﬁ ed characters
In the past, simpler and more complex versions of characters have often coex-
isted. In many cases, the more complicated were used for formal correspon-
dence, and the simpler were used for personal communications. In the 1950s, 
however, as part of a program to promote literacy in the PRC, a set of simpler

characters, most of them based on attested forms, were promoted as a general 
standard for all printed matter. Singapore adopted the new forms for most 
purposes, but Taiwan, Hong Kong, and most overseas communities kept the 
traditional forms; as a result, both types of (formal) characters are now in use 
in the Chinese-speaking world. In English, they are usually referred to as 
‘traditional’ and ‘simpliﬁ ed’. The two types are illustrated below, using the 
phrase Zhōngguórè ‘fascination with Chinese’ (‘middle-kingdom-hot’), roughly 
pronounced [joong-kwoh-ruh].

The three characters cited illustrate the differences nicely. Many characters 
have only one form (like zhōng); many show slight differences (like rè); others 
(like guó) show signiﬁ cant differences but are easily relatable. Relatively few—
no more than a few dozen—are completely different, and most of those are 
commonly encountered. So the differences between the two sets of characters 
are not as signiﬁ cant as might be imagined. A native speaker sees the relation-
ship between the two fairly easily and, using context, moves from one to the 
other without much difﬁ culty. Students generally write only one style, but they 
should be comfortable reading either.
Homophony
Characters represent syllable-length words (or rather, morphemes—the small-
est meaningful units of language). Since, in Chinese, these units are short, the 
chance of homophony is relatively high, more so than in English. In English, 
words pronounced the same are often written the same, as is the case for the 
‘pens’ of ‘pig pen’ and ‘ink pen’. It is also common in English for different 
words of identical pronunciation to be written differently, such as ‘to’, ‘too’, 
and ‘two’. Written Chinese is more comparable to the latter case: words with 
the same pronunciation but different (and unrelated) meanings are written

with different characters. A syllable such as shi can be written dozens of ways, 
depending on the meaning, as the Chinese linguist Yuen Ren Chao demon-
strated in a tour de force whose title was:
߉! ͩ! ࢴ! ໽! Ϋ
Shī shì shí shī shıˇ
(‘[Shi] clan eat lion story’)
‘The tale of how Shī of the Shì clan ate the lion.’
Chao’s tale continues for another 100 or so characters, all pronounced shi in 
one of the four tones. It is written in the very concise prose of Classical Chinese, 
which is normally read out with modern sound values; so while it is just intel-
ligible as written language, it is completely unintelligible as spoken. However, 
written in modern Chinese, many of the words would be disyllabic (shī ‘lion’, 
for example, would be shīzi), and the result would probably be intelligible. 
However, Chao’s exercise makes the point nicely: characters represent words—
units of sound and meaning—and letters represent sounds only.
Transcribing sound in characters
Characters are sometimes used only for their sound values, with the usual 
meanings ignored. In this way, Chinese characters can be used to transcribe 
foreign sounds. So, just as English speakers use Roman letters to write Chinese, 
Chinese speakers sometimes use Chinese characters to write English (or other 
languages). Here is an example from a very simple Chinese-English teaching 
manual from the Mainland (with Chinese written in simpliﬁ ed characters, and 
English written in the Romanized system of transcription that you will soon 
learn). See if you can ﬁ gure out what English sentence is represented.

used for syllabic units, the match is not usually as good as it would be in an 
alphabetic system, which can match a symbol to each consonant and vowel 
sound.
Pictograms, ideograms, logograms
Because some Chinese characters derive from attempts to represent objects 
pictorially, they are sometimes called ‘pictograms’. However, as you will see in 
the character units, the majority of modern characters do not derive directly 
from pictorial representations; even in those cases which do, changes in the 
form of graphs brought about by processes of standardization and writing 
reform over the centuries have generally obscured any representational origins. 
That is not to say that Chinese characters do not have certain aesthetic qualities 
that can be exploited in poetry and art; it is just that these qualities do not 
necessarily play a signiﬁ cant role in ordinary reading or writing.
Because the form of characters is not determined by sound, graphs can be 
borrowed for their meaning and given an entirely different pronunciation. So, 
for example, the character ̋ shān, which originated as a representation of a 
mountain, can be borrowed into Japanese to represent ‘yama’, the Japanese 
word for ‘mountain’. (The same property is found in Arabic numerals: the 
graph ‘8’ is read ‘eight’ in English, ‘osiem’ in Polish, ‘tám’ in Vietnamese, and 
so on.) This property of characters, together with the pictorial origins of many 
of the simple graphs, has given rise to the notion that Chinese characters 
somehow represent meaning directly without the mediation of words, hence 
the term ‘ideogram’. This misconception is a result of viewing characters as 
single entities, outside of normal contexts. In running texts (in Chinese, Japa-
nese, or even Classical Chinese), it is quite clear that readers have to identify 
words and contexts that are linguistic, not just in the realm of thought, in order 
to perceive meaning. Neither the term ‘pictogram’ nor ‘ideogram’ applies to 
Chinese characters.
Writing systems are better named according to the units that they encode. 
Thus, the English writing system basically encodes speciﬁ c sounds (phonemes), 
though there are some word symbols as well (e.g., &, $, %). Chinese basically 
encodes words, though characters may sometimes be called upon to represent

catalogues and in most English-language publications on China. It is known 
for distinguishing the plain initial consonants from the aspirated (g from k, d 
from t, etc., in the pinyin system) by use of an apostrophe: kuo versus k’uo, for 
example, or chung versus ch’ung. (This is phonetically quite sensible since both 
sounds are voiceless in Chinese.)
The Yale system grew out of work performed by the U.S. War Department 
during World War II and was used in the Yale textbook series, familiar to 
several generations of students of Chinese. As much as possible, it used 
the values of English letters to represent Chinese pronunciation, so it is the 
most transparent of all the Romanization systems (for speakers of English).

1919 called Zhùyīn Zìmŭ (‘indicating-sounds alphabet’) that was intended to 
serve as a full-ﬂ edged writing system. It was inspired by the Japanese ‘kana’ 
system, whose symbols derive from characters rather than Roman letters. Bopo 
mofo symbols have the advantage of appearing Chinese and not suggesting any

recent years, some schools in China have been encouraging children at certain 
stages in their education to write essays in pinyin to improve composition and 
style, and it is not unlikely that its functions will continue to expand in the 
future.
It is sometimes claimed that pinyin (or any other such system of transcribing 
the sounds of Mandarin) cannot serve as a full-ﬂ edged writing system because 
the degree of homophony in Chinese is such that some reference to characters 
is necessary for disambiguation. This is certainly true in the case of the shi story 
cited earlier, and it might be true for Classical Chinese in general. However, it 
is certainly not true for texts written in colloquial styles. Anything that can be 
understood in speech can be written and understood in pinyin. Many people e-mail 
successfully in pinyin without even indicating the tones! The question is, using 
pinyin, how far one can stray from colloquial speech and still be understood. 
Written styles range from the relatively colloquial to the relatively classical, but 
if the latter can be understood when read aloud, then they can presumably be 
understood when written in pinyin.

This lesson serves as an introduction to the pronunciation of standard Chinese 
(Mandarin) and to the Hanyu Pinyin transcription system (‘pinyin’). Pinyin will 
represent pronunciation and be your written code for conversational or ‘sayable’ 
material in Chinese. This lesson introduces the whole system but pays particular 
attention to those elements that you will need in order to actually use the language 
in the next lesson, that is, tones, initials, and certain ‘rhymes’. The units that follow 
this lesson will provide you with actual language (transcribed and, in many cases, 
recorded for you). You will be able to refer back to this lesson both to conﬁ rm 
information and to ﬂ esh out the system. As you proceed through the units, you will 
be learning to relate sound to symbol so that you can accurately read out and write 
down the Chinese language samples that you will be practicing.

To learn to speak a language, you need to master its sounds. This is not easy. 
It requires changing habits of articulation that were deeply internalized during 
the ﬁ rst few years of your life and are now quite automatic. It also requires 
learning to pay attention to sounds that may have no particular importance in 
your native language but are crucially important in the new one. What is more, 
while you are establishing these new habits, you have to hold on to the old. 
Eventually, you will learn to switch between two systems, but while you are 
learning, there is bound to be interference from the ﬁ rst language (which will 
likely be English for most users of this book). In the early stages of language 
learning, recordings will help, but the critical role will be played by your 
teachers, who have advice, know the pitfalls, and can provide timely feedback.
As you learn Chinese, you need to be able to write down the new language, 
not simply in an ad hoc fashion, but in a way that allows you to have an unam-
biguous record of the pronunciation. As you know, Chinese has an aesthetically 
pleasing but mnemonically challenging character writing system. Even though 
many characters do offer phonetic hints to those who know where to look, they 
offer no information about pronunciation at all to the learner. To cite a particu-
larly clear case: ෸ is pronounced mù, ೶ is lín, and ྽ is sēn. The graphs are 
additive; the sounds are not. Of course, English is not completely reliable either; 
words like ‘lead’ can be pronounced [leed] or [led], and the three spellings ‘to,’ 
‘too,’ ‘two’ all have the same sound. However, words written in an alphabetical 
system almost always provide some sort of phonetic hint that helps in the 
recovery of sound. (Exceptions in English would be signs such as + or & that 
offer no help to the uninitiated; they are, in fact, functionally like characters.)
The solution for the learner is a system of transcription that represents the 
sounds of Chinese with relatively few symbols and uses them consistently, so 
that—unlike English—words can be pronounced reliably. The Introduction (p. 
xlix) mentioned a number of such systems used for Chinese in the past, many 
of them with virtues. The ofﬁ cial system, used for textbooks, for reference

0.1 Syllable components
0.1.1 Sound versus symbol (letter)
From the start, it is important to make a distinction between sound and the 
representation of sound. In pinyin, for example, jī represents a sound like [jee] 
(with ‘level tone’), qī represents [chee]. Neither is hard (for English speakers) 
to imitate, but the way the latter is represented—with a ‘q’ (and no subsequent 
‘u’)—is counterintuitive and difﬁ cult to remember at ﬁ rst. On the other hand, 
pinyin r represents a sound that, for many speakers of standard Chinese, is a 
blend of the ‘r’ of ‘run’ with the ‘s’ (pronounced [ž]) of ‘pleasure’ (or the ‘j’ of 
French je)—in other words, an ‘r’ with friction. This sound may be difﬁ cult for 
non-Chinese speakers to produce well, but associating it with the symbol ‘r’ is 
less problematical. So, as you learn pinyin, you may encounter problems of

pronunciation on the one hand, and problems of transcription on the other. It 
is important to keep the distinction clear.
0.1.2 The syllable
When introducing the sounds of standard Chinese, it is useful to begin with 
the syllable, a unit whose prominence is underscored by the one-character-per-
syllable writing system. The spoken syllable in Chinese is traditionally analyzed 
in terms of an initial consonant sound and a rhyme, the latter being everything 
other than the initial. Chinese schoolchildren, when focusing on pronunciation, 
often read syllables (which are usually also meaningful units) in an exaggerated 
initial-rhyme division: tuh + ù = tù ‘hare’, luh + óng = lóng ‘dragon’, etc.
The written pinyin syllable (as opposed to the spoken syllable) can also be 
usefully analyzed in terms of an initial (Ci) and a rhyme. The rhyme, in turn, 
contains vowels (V), tones (T) written above the vowels, medials (M), and 
endings (E). Of these, only the vowel is always present (as, for example, in the 
sentence-ﬁ nal particle that is simply an untoned a). All possible pinyin syllables 
can be represented by the following formula (with V underlined as the only 
obligatory unit); there are so few options for M (medials) and E (endings) that 
they can be usefully listed in our formula.

There are 21 pinyin initial consonants. They are usually presented in a chart 
of representative syllables, arranged in rows and columns (see section 0.3.1). 
Whether the initials are written with a single consonant letter (l, m, z) or several 
(sh, zh), they all represent only one sound unit (or phoneme). Chinese has no 
initial clusters—consonant blends—of the sort represented by ‘cl’ or ‘sn’ in 
English.
There are six possible (written) vowels: a, e, i, o, u, and ü (the last a ‘rounded 
high front’ vowel, as in German über or the last vowel of French déjà vu). Vowels 
can be preceded by medials (i, u, ü) and followed by endings, two of which are 
written with vowel symbols (i, o) and two with consonants (n, ng). There is 
actually a third (written) vowel ending that can occur after the main vowel (in 
addition to i and o), and that is u. When the main vowel is o, the ending o is 
written u to avoid the misleading combination ‘oo’. Thus, to cite words from 
Unit 1, one ﬁ nds haˇo and laˇo (both with a+o), but instead of ‘dōo’ or ‘zhōo’ 
(o+o), you get dōu and zhōu (both with u).
Notice that the inventory of consonant endings in Chinese is small—there 
are only n and ng. Regional languages, such as Cantonese, have more (-p, -t, 
-m, etc.). The English name of the Chinese frying pan, the ‘wok’, is derived 
from a Cantonese word with a ﬁ nal [k] sound; its standard Chinese counterpart, 
guō, lacks the ﬁ nal consonant. In historical terms, standard Chinese has lost 
most ﬁ nal consonants, while Cantonese has preserved them. Surnames often 
demonstrate this same distinction between the presence and absence of a ﬁ nal 
consonant in standard Chinese and Cantonese: Lu/Luk, Ye/Yip, for example 
(see Unit 4, Appendix 2 for more examples).
Tones are a particularly interesting feature of the Chinese sound system and 
will be discussed in more detail below. For now, we note that stressed syllables 
may have one of four possible tones, indicated by the use of diacritical marks 
written over the main vowel (V). Unstressed syllables, however, do not have 
tonal contrasts; their pitch is, for the most part, conditioned by that of sur-
rounding syllables.
Because medials, vowels, and some endings are all written with vowel letters, 
pinyin rhymes may have strings of two or three vowel letters, such as: iu, iao, 
uai. This can be confusing, particularly with ‘opposites’ such as iu/ui, ie/ei, and

focus on such vowel combinations.
By convention, the tone mark is placed on the vowel proper, not on the 
medial or ending, as in: lèi, jiāo, zuò. As a rule of thumb, look to see if the ﬁ rst 
of two vowel letters is a possible medial. If it is, then the following vowel letter 
is the core vowel, which receives the tone mark; if it is not, then this ﬁ rst letter 
is the core vowel: liè, zhaˇo, xué, dōu, jiào.

One sound that is not shown in the syllable formula given above is the ﬁ nal 
‘r’ sound. It is represented, not surprisingly, by r in pinyin, and is obligatory 
in a few words with the written e-vowel, such as èr ‘two’. In northern varieties 
of standard Chinese, a common word-building sufﬁ x, appearing mostly in 
nouns and favored by some speakers and regions more than others, is also 
represented by a ﬁ nal r: diaˇnr, huàr, bànr, huángr. The ﬁ nal r often blends with 
the rest of the syllable according to rather complicated rules that will be dis-
cussed in detail in later lessons.

Words in Chinese are pronounced with a regular tonal contour, much like the 
stress patterns that distinguish the English verb ‘reCORD’ from the noun 
‘REcord’. In Chinese, the word laˇ oshī ‘teacher’, for example, is pronounced laoshi 
(‘low’ followed by ‘high’). In English terms, this is like having to say TEAcher 
rather than teaCHER or TEACHER (with both syllables stressed) each time you 
say the word. The presence of tones in Chinese is often cited as another of 
those lurid features that make the language unique and difﬁ cult to learn; but

tones are, in fact, not unique to Chinese and probably no more difﬁ cult to learn 
than stress or intonation is for learners of English.
As noted earlier, there are four basic tones in Mandarin. This is far fewer than 
some of the regional Chinese languages. Cantonese, for example, is usually ana-
lyzed as having four tones on two levels, plus one, for a total of nine. Mandarin 
also differs from many of the regional languages in having a predilection for 
words with (non-initial) toneless syllables: shūshu ‘uncle’; xíngli ‘luggage’.
0.2.1 The four tones
It is difﬁ cult to learn to produce or even recognize tones from descriptions, 
though we will use the descriptive terms ‘high (and level)’, ‘rising’, ‘low’, and 
‘falling’ as a way of referring to them. These terms are only suggestive of the 
actual shape of the tone, but they do underscore the symmetry of the system: 
a high and a low, a rising and a falling. In modern Chinese, though the tones 
have formal names (that can only be rationalized by reference to earlier stages 
of the language), it is common practice to refer to them numerically by using 
the numbers 1–4 (yī, èr, sān, sì) and the word for sound, shēng [shuhng]: yīshēng, 
èrshēng, sānshēng, sìshēng. (Toneless syllables are called qīngshēng ‘light-toned’.) 
In English, we can also refer to the tones as ‘ﬁ rst’, ‘second’, ‘third’, and ‘fourth’. 
As noted earlier, in pinyin, tones are indicated by marks placed over the main 
vowel letter.

of as sung out, because singing a syllable in English usually results in a sus-
tained level pitch similar to the high tone. The second tone, which rises from 
mid-low to high, can be associated with doubt or uncertainty: ‘Did you say 
“tea”? “milk”? “Mao”? “Wang”?’ The third tone is the subject of the next para-
graph, but the fourth tone, which falls from very high to low, can usefully be 
associated with list ﬁ nal intonation: ‘One, two, three (all rising), and four!’ For 
many people, the fourth tone contour is also associated with certainty: ‘I said 
“Wèi”’ or ‘It’s late.’
0.2.3 The low tone
You will notice that the pinyin symbol for the low tone is v-shaped, suggesting 
a contour that falls, then rises. In isolation, it does indeed fall and rise: haˇo ‘be 
good’; woˇ ‘I; me’; jiaˇng ‘speak; explain’. In close conjunction with a following 
syllable (other than one with the same low tone, as shown below), it tends to 
have a low, non-rising pitch.
If you can ﬁ nd a Chinese speaker to model the following phrases (from Unit

hěn gāo 
‘tall’
hěn máng 
‘busy’
hěn lèi 
‘tired’
For most speakers, a low-toned syllable in the second position of a phrase 
will also stay low, without much of a rise. Again, if you can ﬁ nd a speaker

primarily low.

of as sung out, because singing a syllable in English usually results in a sus-
tained level pitch similar to the high tone. The second tone, which rises from 
mid-low to high, can be associated with doubt or uncertainty: ‘Did you say 
“tea”? “milk”? “Mao”? “Wang”?’ The third tone is the subject of the next para-
graph, but the fourth tone, which falls from very high to low, can usefully be 
associated with list ﬁ nal intonation: ‘One, two, three (all rising), and four!’ For 
many people, the fourth tone contour is also associated with certainty: ‘I said 
“Wèi”’ or ‘It’s late.’
0.2.3 The low tone
You will notice that the pinyin symbol for the low tone is v-shaped, suggesting 
a contour that falls, then rises. In isolation, it does indeed fall and rise: haˇo ‘be 
good’; woˇ ‘I; me’; jiaˇng ‘speak; explain’. In close conjunction with a following 
syllable (other than one with the same low tone, as shown below), it tends to 
have a low, non-rising pitch.

the third tone as ‘low’, and to produce it, you aim low and add the ﬁ nal rise 
only when the syllable is isolated.
0.2.4 Toneless syllables
Syllables in initial position in Mandarin almost always have one of the four 
tones, but those following a toned syllable can be toneless. In Chinese, such 
syllables have qīngshēng ‘the light tone’. In this respect, Mandarin contrasts with 
some regional Chinese languages such as Cantonese, in which almost all syl-
lables are toned, regardless of their position in the word.
Mandarin toneless syllables are of two types: those which never have full 
tones and those which can have tones but may become toneless after a stressed 
syllable. The question particle, ma, is an example of the ﬁ rst: Máng ma? ‘Are 
[you] busy?’ The ﬁ nal ma never has a tone. Other common examples are the 
many compound words with iambic stress pattern such as xíngli ‘luggage’ and 
shūfu ‘to be comfortable’. The second type will be discussed in Unit 2, after you 
have examples to refer to.
0.2.5 The tone chart
The chart below uses twelve of the most common surnames to illustrate the 
four tones. In Chinese, the surname is the ﬁ rst component of the full name, 
not the last (e.g., Lıˇ in Lıˇ Liánjié—Jet Li’s Chinese name). In the chart, the four 
tones are characterized in terms of their pitch contours (high and level, rising, 
etc.) as well as by the four heuristic concepts (sung out, doubt, etc.) that will 
help you to produce them correctly.

0.2.6 An aside on the history of Chinese tones
Tone systems as complex as those of Chinese are a feature of dozens of lan-
guages spoken in China and adjoining regions of mainland Southeast Asia, 
including the national languages of Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam. One tends 
to think of tone as being primarily a matter of pitch—like notes in a song. Pitch 
is controlled by stretching or loosening the vocal chords in the throat, rather 
like what happens when you stretch or loosen the mouth of a balloon. Tone is 
often more than just pitch. Even in standard Chinese, it is also associated with 
length; the rising tone, for example, is noticeably shorter than the high, level 
tone. In Southeast Asian languages, such as standard Vietnamese and Burmese,

ferent dialect groups. In standard Cantonese, for example, the four-tone system 
split into two sets of four tones each, with one set relatively higher than the 
other; an additional distinct tone derived from another split, providing a total 
of nine distinctive tones.
You may feel fortunate that the Mandarin dialects did not undergo the same 
development as Cantonese. In Mandarin, the ancient four-tone system remained 
as four tones, but they underwent a redistribution. Words with the rù tone, 
for example, are no longer a distinctive set in Mandarin; they have joined 
with words whose tones were originally píng, shaˇng, or qù. The rù-toned words 
were distinguished mainly by the ﬁ nal stopped consonants (‘p’, ‘t’, ‘k’), and 
once those were lost, the rù tone was no longer distinct from the other three 
tones.
In another Mandarin development, píng-toned words split into two groups 
and formed two of the four modern tones, ﬁ rst tone (high and level) and second 
tone (rising), a development that is reﬂ ected in the names of those tones in 
modern Chinese, yīnpíng and yángpíng. Yīnpíng arose from píng-toned syllables 
with yīn—or voiced initial consonants; yángpíng arose from píng-toned syllables 
with yáng—or voiceless initials. So the modern tones that you ﬁ nd in the stan-
dard language, though still four in number, are neither pronounced the same 
way nor found on the same words as in the four-tone system that existed some 
1,500 years ago.
A more detailed discussion of both the historical development of tone in 
Chinese and the tonal systems found in other varieties of Chinese can be found 
in books such as Norman (1988), listed at the end of the Introduction.
0.3 Initial consonants
First, note that many pinyin letters are pronounced similarly to their English 
equivalents; the l in laˇo, for example, is very like the English ‘l’, and the pinyin 
f, s, n, and m all have more or less the same values in Chinese and English 
scripts. Unfortunately, such cases are liable to make you think of English even 
when pinyin letters have values that are rather different. Below is a table of 
symbols that represent all possible initial consonants of Chinese. Following

Chinese custom, they are presented with a particular set of vowels and ordered 
from front of the mouth (labials) to back (velars and glottals).
0.3.1 The consonant chart
First, letters w and y, which do appear initially in pinyin (e.g., the numbers wuˇ 
‘ﬁ ve’ and yī ‘one’), are treated as special cases of medial u and i, respectively, 
in initial position. Thus, instead of ‘ī’, one ﬁ nds yī; instead of ‘uˇ’, wuˇ ; instead 
of ‘iě’, yě; instead of ‘uoˇ’, woˇ; etc. This will be discussed again in detail later.
Second, the vowels conventionally placed with the different classes of initials 
to make them pronounceable turn out to be some of those that have quite idio-
syncratic values for speakers of English. Thus, the o in the ﬁ rst line of the table 
below is not pronounced like the English long vowel ‘o’ but more like the vowel 
sound in the word ‘paw’; the e in the second line is pronounced [uh]; the i in 
the third and fourth lines represents a continuation of the initial into a buzz 
(e.g., zi [dzz]; zhi [jrr]), but in the ﬁ fth line it represents the more expected [ee] 
(e.g., ji [jee]). The vowel sounds will be discussed in §0.4 below, but for now, you 
can use the hints provided in the far right column of the chart and imitate your 
teacher or the audio. You should learn to declaim (for sound) and write (for

0.3.2 Notes on the consonant chart
COLUMNS I AND II In English, the distinction between sounds typically written 
‘b’ and ‘p’ or ‘d’ and ‘t’ is usually said to be one of voicing (vocal chord vibra-
tion): with ‘b’ and ‘d’, voicing begins relatively earlier than with ‘p’ and ‘t’. 
However, in Chinese, the onset of voicing of the column I consonants is dif-
ferent from that of English. The sound represented by b in pinyin is actually 
between the English [b] and [p]; that represented by d is between the English 
[d] and [t], etc. This is why the Wade-Giles system of Romanization (mentioned 
in the Introduction) uses ‘p, p’ ’ (i.e., p, p-apostrophe) rather than ‘b, p’ (T’aipei 
rather than Taibei). In phonetic terms, both b and p are voiceless in pinyin, but 
the ﬁ rst is unaspirated while the second is aspirated (that is, accompanied by 
a noticeable explosion of air). Being aware of this will help you to adjust to what 
you hear; in fact, the English letters ‘b’, ‘d’, and ‘g’ are not highly voiced by 
most speakers (compared to their equivalents in, say, French and Spanish), so 
if you pronounce them ‘lightly’ in Chinese, you will not have too strong an 
accent. Contrast: bo/po, de/te, ge/ke; and zi/ci, zhi/chi, ji/qi.
ROW 1 These consonants are ‘labials’, or those whose pronunciation involve 
the lips. The pinyin o (not ou) only appears after the labials (bo po mo fo) and 
is, for many English speakers, pronounced like [aw] in ‘paw’. Everywhere other 
than after labial consonants, the same sound is written uo. Thus bo, po, mo, 
and fo rhyme with duo, tuo, nuo, and luo (the latter set not shown in the table 
above). In other words, o by itself always equals uo (and never ou). Apparently, 
the creators of pinyin felt that, following labial initials, it was not necessary to 
indicate the labial onset with ‘u’. It will be important to keep the sound of o/
uo separate from that of ou. The last (ou) rhymes with both syllables of the 
English exclamation ‘oh no’.
ROWS 3, 4, AND 5—THE CRUCIAL ROWS! With z, c, and s in row 3, the tongue is 
tense but ﬂ at and touching the back of the teeth near the gum line. The letter 
i, following row 3 initials, is not pronounced [ee]; it simply represents a continu-
ation of the consonant sound. So, for zi, ci, and si, think [dzz], [tsz], and [ssz]

the creators of pinyin felt that, following labial initials, it was not necessary to 
indicate the labial onset with ‘u’. It will be important to keep the sound of o/
uo separate from that of ou. The last (ou) rhymes with both syllables of the 
English exclamation ‘oh no’.
ROWS 3, 4, AND 5—THE CRUCIAL ROWS! With z, c, and s in row 3, the tongue is 
tense but ﬂ at and touching the back of the teeth near the gum line. The letter 
i, following row 3 initials, is not pronounced [ee]; it simply represents a continu-
ation of the consonant sound. So, for zi, ci, and si, think [dzz], [tsz], and [ssz]

(as indicated in the far left column). English does not have consonant sounds 
comparable to the ﬁ rst two row 3 initials, z and c, except across root boundar-
ies: pads, cats. In German and Russian, though, similar sounds do occur at the 
beginning of words, such as in German zehn [dz-] ‘ten’, or Russian cená [ts-] 
‘price’. The latter example, also written with a ‘c’, demonstrates the Russian 
inﬂ uence on the creators of pinyin.
With zh, ch, sh, and r in row 4, the tongue is pulled back and the tip is raised 
toward the roof of the mouth (on or near the rough area behind the teeth known 
as the alveolar ridge) in what is called a retroﬂ ex position. When preceding 
vowels without lip rounding (all but o or u), including i as in the table (zhi, 
etc.), the lips are tight and slightly spread, which allows teachers to see and 
hear whether the retroﬂ ex series is being pronounced correctly. As with the 
row 3 initials, the letter i in this position represents only a buzz. So, for zhi, 
chi, shi, and ri, think [jr], [chr], [shr], and [rr]. In English, an ‘r’ following a 
consonant will often produce the retroﬂ ex articulation of the tongue that is 
characteristic of the row 4 consonants. Another way to ensure that your tongue 
is in the correct position for those initials is to match zh to the ‘dr’ of ‘drill’, ch 
to the ‘tr’ of ‘trill’, sh to the ‘shr’ of ‘shrill’, and r to the ‘r’ of ‘rill’.
Finally, with j, q, and x of row 5, the tongue is positioned like the ‘yie’ in 
English ‘yield’. This time, the letter i is pronounced [ee], so for ji, qi, and xi, 
think [jyee], [chyee], and [syee]. Later, you will see that row 5 initials are followed 
only by the written vowels i and u. The ﬁ rst will always be pronounced [ee] 
in this context; the second will always be pronounced [ü]. Every time you 
encounter row 5 initials, think i is [ee] and u is [ü].
THE INITIAL R OF ROW 4 Pronunciation of the letter ‘r’ varies considerably

uvulas; the Spanish ﬂ ap their tongues; and the well-known American television 
interviewer, Barbara Walters, pronounces it like a cross between [r] and [w]. 
The Chinese r is different again; it has a little bit of a buzz to it. Like zh, ch, 
and sh, it is retroﬂ ex (with tongue pushed back and tip raised) so it resembles 
the initial sound of English ‘rill’ or ‘ridge’, but it also has friction like the ‘s’ in 
‘pleasure’ (or French je ‘I’). You will observe considerable variation in the

(as indicated in the far left column). English does not have consonant sounds 
comparable to the ﬁ rst two row 3 initials, z and c, except across root boundar-
ies: pads, cats. In German and Russian, though, similar sounds do occur at the 
beginning of words, such as in German zehn [dz-] ‘ten’, or Russian cená [ts-] 
‘price’. The latter example, also written with a ‘c’, demonstrates the Russian 
inﬂ uence on the creators of pinyin.
With zh, ch, sh, and r in row 4, the tongue is pulled back and the tip is raised 
toward the roof of the mouth (on or near the rough area behind the teeth known 
as the alveolar ridge) in what is called a retroﬂ ex position. When preceding 
vowels without lip rounding (all but o or u), including i as in the table (zhi, 
etc.), the lips are tight and slightly spread, which allows teachers to see and 
hear whether the retroﬂ ex series is being pronounced correctly. As with the 
row 3 initials, the letter i in this position represents only a buzz. So, for zhi, 
chi, shi, and ri, think [jr], [chr], [shr], and [rr]. In English, an ‘r’ following a 
consonant will often produce the retroﬂ ex articulation of the tongue that is 
characteristic of the row 4 consonants. Another way to ensure that your tongue 
is in the correct position for those initials is to match zh to the ‘dr’ of ‘drill’, ch 
to the ‘tr’ of ‘trill’, sh to the ‘shr’ of ‘shrill’, and r to the ‘r’ of ‘rill’.
Finally, with j, q, and x of row 5, the tongue is positioned like the ‘yie’ in 
English ‘yield’. This time, the letter i is pronounced [ee], so for ji, qi, and xi, 
think [jyee], [chyee], and [syee]. Later, you will see that row 5 initials are followed 
only by the written vowels i and u. The ﬁ rst will always be pronounced [ee] 
in this context; the second will always be pronounced [ü]. Every time you 
encounter row 5 initials, think i is [ee] and u is [ü].
THE INITIAL R OF ROW 4 Pronunciation of the letter ‘r’ varies considerably 
among languages: the Scots trill their tongue tips; the Parisians ﬂ utter their 
uvulas; the Spanish ﬂ ap their tongues; and the well-known American television 
interviewer, Barbara Walters, pronounces it like a cross between [r] and [w].

0.4 Rhymes
A table showing all possible rhymes follows below. It is too long and compli-
cated to be quickly internalized like the chart of initials, but you can practice 
reading the rows aloud with the help of a Chinese speaker. You can also map 
your progress through the rhymes by circling syllables, or adding meaningful 
examples, as you learn new words.
The table is organized by main vowel (a, e, i, o, u, ü), and then within 
each vowel by medial (i, u, and ü) and ﬁ nal (i, o/u, n, ng). The penultimate 
column, marked ‘w/o Ci’ (i.e., ‘without initial consonant’), lists syllables 
that lack an initial consonant (with the rarer ones placed in parentheses) and 
thus begin with a (written) vowel or medial (the latter always represented with 
an initial y or w). The ﬁ nal column provides pronunciation hints. Asterisks 
(*) following certain row numbers indicate sets that require special atten-
tion. Final r, whose special properties were mentioned above, is treated 
separately.

0.4.1 Notes on the i and u rhymes and Ci
Recall that, in the Ci chart presented earlier, the row 4 Ci (zh, ch, sh, r) are dis-
tinguished from the row 5 Ci ( j, q, x) by position of the tongue. In terms of 
English sounds and spellings, the distinction between ‘j’, ‘ch’, and ‘sh’ depends 
upon tongue position—‘dr, tr, shr’ (zhi, chi, shi) versus the ‘y’ of ‘yield’ ( ji, qi, 
xi). This difference, even if appreciated, seems, nonetheless, very slight. Indeed, 
it would be much more difﬁ cult to perceive if the vowels following these initial 
consonants were identically pronounced. But they never are!
Note that row 5 Ci initials ( j, q, x) are only followed by the medial sounds 
(not the written letters) [ee] and [ü], written i and u, respectively. Here are some 
examples (which can be read with a level tone).
ji, jie, jian, qi, qie, qian, xi, xie, xian; ju, jue, jun, qu, que, qun, xu, xue, 
xun.
Row 3 and row 4 Ci, on the other hand, are never followed by the medial 
sounds [ee] or [ü].
zhi, zi, zhu, zu, zhan, zan, chi, ci, chu, cu, chan, chen, etc.
Because the creators of pinyin let i and u each represent two different sounds, 
this complementary distribution is obscured: the vowels of ji and zhi look alike, 
but they do not sound alike; the same is true for ju and zhu. Therefore, if you 
hear [chee], it must be written qi, for the sound [ee] never follows ch; if you 
hear [chang], it must be written chang, for q can only be followed by the sound 
[ee]. This may sound complicated—and it is—but there is plenty of practice to 
come, beginning with Exercise 4.
0.4.2 The value of the letter e
The value of e also violates the expectations of English speakers. It is pro-
nounced [uh] in all contexts (zé, dēng, chén), except after a written i or u, when 
it is pronounced [eh] (xiē, niē, xuē), or before a written i, when it is pronounced 
[ay] as in the English word ‘way’ (lèi, bèi, zéi).

are very difﬁ cult to correct later, so you need to make sure you master them 
early. The rhyme ou, with the leading o, is pronounced like the name of the

Exercise 6
0.4.4 The ü rhymes
Section 0.4.1 (after the list of rhymes) makes the point that many of the ü 
rhymes are revealed by the type of initial consonant. Following row 5 initials 
(j, q, x), u is always pronounced the same as ü; following any other initial, it is 
pronounced [oo]. This results in distinct pronunciations (with any particular 
tone) for: zhu/ju, chu/qu, and shu/xu, but similar pronunciations for pu, fu, du, 
ku, and hu. However, the sound [ü] also occurs after the initials n and l, as well 
as those of row 5. In these cases, ü may contrast with u, and the difference has 
to be shown on the vowel, not on the initial. Examples include: lù ‘road’ versus 
lü` ‘green’; nuˇ  ‘crossbow’ versus nüˇ ‘female’. In addition to being a core vowel, 
ü also occurs as a medial. Again, when it follows row 5 initials, it is written as 
u: jué, quē, xuě; but following l or n, it is written as ü: lüèzì ‘abbreviation’; nüèji 
‘malaria’. In the latter cases, it is redundant, since there is no contrast between 
üe and ue.

0.4.4 The ü rhymes
Section 0.4.1 (after the list of rhymes) makes the point that many of the ü 
rhymes are revealed by the type of initial consonant. Following row 5 initials 
(j, q, x), u is always pronounced the same as ü; following any other initial, it is 
pronounced [oo]. This results in distinct pronunciations (with any particular 
tone) for: zhu/ju, chu/qu, and shu/xu, but similar pronunciations for pu, fu, du, 
ku, and hu. However, the sound [ü] also occurs after the initials n and l, as well 
as those of row 5. In these cases, ü may contrast with u, and the difference has 
to be shown on the vowel, not on the initial. Examples include: lù ‘road’ versus 
lü` ‘green’; nuˇ  ‘crossbow’ versus nüˇ ‘female’. In addition to being a core vowel, 
ü also occurs as a medial. Again, when it follows row 5 initials, it is written as

0.5 Miscellany
0.5.1 Tonal shifts
Before leaving the survey of sounds and notation, we need to return to the 
subject of tone, and take note of the phenomenon of tonal shifting (called ‘tone 
sandhi’ by linguists). It turns out that in certain contexts, Chinese tones undergo 
shifts from one to another. (In standard Chinese, the contexts where this 
occurs are very limited; in regional languages such as Hokkien, such shifts are 
much more pervasive, affecting almost every syllable.) We will mention these 
shifts here, and then practice producing them more systematically in later 
lessons.
0.5.2 Low-tone shift
If two low tones (tone 3) appear consecutively in the same phrase, the ﬁ rst tone 
is pronounced with a rising tone:
3 + 3 
→ 
2 + 3
low + low 
→ 
rising + low
hěn + haˇo 
→
hén haˇo ‘good’
hěn + lěng
→
hén lěng ‘cold’
Lıˇ  + laˇoshī 
→ 
Lí laˇoshī ‘Professor Lee’
It is, of course, possible to have three or more low tones in a row, but such 
cases will be considered later.
0.5.3 Two single-word shifts
There also exist a few more idiosyncratic shifts that involve only single words. 
The negative, bu, is usually pronounced with a falling tone except when it is 
followed by another falling tone, in which case it shifts and is pronounced with 
a rising tone: bù haˇo ‘not well’, but bú lèi ‘not tired’. In the latter case, the result 
is a trajectory like the sides of a mountain, up then down, and students in the 
past have kept track of this shift by calling it the ‘Fuji shift’ (after Mount Fuji, 
which is, of course, in Japan, not China). Below, bu is shown in combination 
with some adjectival verbs (called stative verbs in Chinese grammatical tradi-

tion); these sets (involving stative verbs from the conversational material in 
Unit 1) should be repeated regularly until fully internalized.
bù gāo

bù máng
‘not busy’
bù haˇo
‘not well’
Tone shift: 
bú lèi
‘not tired’
bú è
‘not hungry’
bú rè
‘not hot’
bú cuò
‘not bad’
Another single-word shift involves the numeral yī ‘one’. In counting, and in 
many compounds, it is level toned (yīshēng): yī, èr, sān, sì ‘one, two, three, four’. 
When yī is grammatically linked to a subsequent ‘measure word’, it adopts the 
same tonal shift as bu, rising before a falling tone (yí fèn ‘a copy’), but falling 
before any other tone (yì bāo ‘a pack’).
yì zhāng 
‘a [table]’
yì tiáo 
‘a [ﬁ sh]’
yì běn 
‘a [book]’
But:
yí fèn
‘a copy [of a newspaper]’
Note that the low tone shift (hěn + haˇo = hén haˇo) applies to any word (or 
syllable) that ﬁ ts the grammatical condition (located within a phrase); but the 
shift from falling to rising affects only a few words, most commonly bu and yi.
0.5.4 The apostrophe
In certain contexts, an apostrophe appears between the syllables of a compound 
written in pinyin: Xī’ān (a city in China); haˇi’ōu ‘seagull’; choˇng’ài ‘to dote on’. 
The apostrophe is used when a syllable beginning with a vowel letter (a, e, o) 
is preceded (without a space) by another syllable; in other words, where the 
syllable boundary is ambiguous. By convention, the apostrophe is only used 
when the trailing syllable begins with a vowel; a word like yīngān, with two 
potential syllable divisions (yīn-gān, yīng-ān), is always to be interpreted as 
yīn+gān, never yīng+ān (which would be yīng’ān).

0.5.5 Interaction of tone and intonation
You may wonder whether a tonal language like Chinese, in which pitch adheres 
to individual syllables (with some accommodation across syllables), permits 
intonational pitch movements of the sort associated with contrast, denial, cor-
rection, and other kinds of emotional speech in English: ‘That’s a HIGH tone?!’ 
Nà shi PÍNGshēng ma?
It turns out that Chinese (and other tonal languages) do have intonation 
contours, but rather than obliterating the word tones, they envelope them, 
exaggerating the pitch contours of key words, while narrowing the pitch con-
tours of others. In the example above, píng is louder and its pitch rises to an 
exaggerated height, while the other syllables are diminished with shorter but 
nonetheless distinctive contours. You will have plenty of opportunities to prac-
tice superimposing intonation over tone as you work through the material in 
the core units.
People often ask about singing in tonal languages. Surely melody must oblit-
erate word tone, or else you would have to choose your words to ﬁ t the melody 
and songs would resemble speech. The famous Chinese linguist Yuen Ren 
Chao (who provided the epigraph that began this lesson) considered this ques-
tion in an article published in 1956 and concluded that, while the melodies of 
certain traditional song forms accounted for word tone, modern Chinese songs 
did not. Certainly, that is the way it appears. In the well-known folksong 
whose title translates as ‘The Couple Returning Home’ (०໔ၷၷڳଜથ Fūqī 
shuāngshuāng baˇ jiā huán), the ﬁ rst two lines begin with fourth-tone words (ၥ 
shù ‘tree’ and ൊ lü` ‘green’), yet the ﬁ rst is distinctly high in the melody, and 
the second is distinctly low. However, it should be noted that Wong and Diehl 
(2008) reached a different conclusion for Cantonese, which has a richer tone 
system than standard Chinese.

indicate pronunciation and provide a means for alphabetical organization. 
For this reason, the rules and conventions for writing connected text in 
pinyin were not well deﬁ ned at ﬁ rst. However, increasing use of computers 
for the input and production of text and in everyday communication, as 
well as the proliferation of contact between China and the rest of the 
world, has put a premium on the use of pinyin. Nowadays, in addition to 
its use in pedagogical materials such as this textbook, pinyin is widely 
used in e-mails, for word processing input, for Web and e-mail addresses, 
and to complement characters on advertisements, announcements, and 
menus (particularly those intended for an international audience in China 
and abroad).
In 1988, the State Language Commission issued a document with the 
translated title of “The Basic Rules for Hanyu Pinyin Orthography” and, with 
a few minor exceptions, this textbook conforms to those proposed rules. 
(The ABC Chinese-English Dictionary, cited at the end of the Introduction, 
contains a translation of this document as an appendix.) Only two general 
points need to be mentioned here. First, basic English punctuation practices 
hold. Sentences begin with capital letters, as do proper nouns, and they end 
with periods. Other punctuation marks are used more or less as they are in 
English.
Second, words, not syllables, are enclosed by spaces. Thus, ‘teacher’ is written 
laˇoshī, not laˇo shī. Characters, by contrast, which always represent syllable-
length units, are evenly spaced regardless of word boundaries. Of course, deﬁ n-
ing what a word is can be problematic, but pinyin dictionaries or glossaries can 
usually be relied upon to make those decisions for us. Other conventions, such 
as the use of the hyphen, will be noted in this book when needed. When you 
write pinyin, it should follow this format:
Gémìng bú shì qıˇngkè chīfàn.

Chinese who studied English during the early years of the People’s Republic 
of China can often remember their ﬁ rst English sentence, because in those 
days textbook material was polemical and didactic, and lesson content was care-
fully chosen for content and gravity. Let your ﬁ rst sentences also carry some

This is the ﬁ rst lesson in which you actually begin to use the language, 
starting with simple questions and responses about states (e.g., ‘Are you 
tired?’ / ‘Not very.’) and events (e.g., ‘Have you eaten?’ / ‘Yes, I have.’). In 
the course of presenting these simple interactions, you will be introduced to 
a range of verbs, pronouns, methods of asking ‘yes/no’ questions, and ways 
of answering afﬁ rmatively or negatively. You will also learn how to count, 
give dates, greet, and take your leave. In the ﬁ rst four units, you will be 
paying special attention to pronunciation and becoming more familiar with 
pinyin.

1.1 Conventions
The previous lesson on sounds and symbols provided the ﬁ rst steps in learning 
to associate the pinyin transcription of Chinese language material with accurate 
pronunciation. The task will continue as you start to learn to converse by listen-
ing to conversational material while reading it in the pinyin script. However, 
in these early units, it will be all too easy to fall back into associations based 
on English spelling, and so, occasionally (as in the previous overview), Chinese 
cited in pinyin will be followed by phonetic hints in brackets, such as: máng 
[mahng] or hěn [huhn]. These are only intended to alert you to potential pro-
blems and remind you of what you have been hearing on the audio and from 
your teachers.
Where needed, you will be provided with an idiomatic English translation 
of Chinese material in addition to a word-for-word gloss in parentheses. 
The latter takes you deeper into the world of Chinese linguistic concepts and 
allows you to better understand how meanings are composed. The following 
conventions are used to make the presentation of this information as clear as 
possible.
Parentheses (.  .  .) 
enclose literal meanings, e.g.: Máng ma? 
(‘be+busy Q’)
Plusses (+) 
indicate both meanings combined in the Chinese 
word, e.g., nín (‘you+POL’). Also used to 
distinguish, in certain cases, two particles, both 
pronounced de but written with different 
characters. See §2.8.3, e.g., shuō+de hěn haˇo.
Capitals (Q) 
indicate grammatical notions, e.g., Q for 
‘question’; POL for ‘polite’. In cases where there

appear around words, e.g., hěn haˇo versus 
shūfu. Spaces are also used instead of + in 
glosses, e.g., haˇochī (‘be good-eat’) rather than 
(‘be+good-eat’)
Hyphens (-) 
are used in standard pinyin transcription to link 
certain constituents, e.g., dì-yī ‘ﬁ rst’ or maˇma-
hūhū ‘so-so’. In the English glosses, hyphens 
indicate the meanings of the constituent parts of 
Chinese compounds: haˇochī (‘be good-eat’).
Brackets [ ] 
indicate pronouns and other material that is 
obligatorily expressed in one language but not in 
the other, e.g., Máng ma? ‘Are [you] busy?’ In 
deﬁ nitions, brackets enclose notes on style or 
other relevant information, e.g., bàng ‘be good; 
super’ [colloquial]. Finally, brackets also enclose 
phonetic hints and other indications of 
pronunciation other than pinyin, e.g., hěn [huhn].
Angle brackets   
indicate optional material: Nıˇ  lèi ma? means 
that either Nıˇ lèi ma? or Lèi ma? are both 
possible.
Tildes (∼) 
indicate variant(s).

1.2.1 Word Pairs
To get your vocal organs ready to pronounce Chinese, it is useful to contrast 
the articulatory settings of Chinese and English by pronouncing pairs of words 
selected for their similarity of sound. Thus, kaˇo ‘to test’ differs from English 
‘cow’ not only in tone, but also in vowel quality.

single ﬁ gure: yī-jiuˇ -jiuˇ -liù nián ‘1996’; èr-líng-líng-sān nián ‘2003’. Months are 
formed regularly with numerals: yīyuè ‘January’, èryuè ‘February’, shí’èryuè 
‘December’.

b. In the written language, rì ‘day’ (a much simpler character) is often used in place of hào. 
Thus, bāyuè sān rì (ڭᏜྯ྇), which would be written and read out as such, would tend to be

1.3.5 The celestial stems
Just as English sometimes makes use of letters rather than numbers to indicate 
a sequence of items, so Chinese sometimes makes use of a closed set of words 
with ﬁ xed order known as shígān ‘the ten stems’ or tiāngān ‘the celestial stems’ 
for counting purposes. The ten stems have an interesting history, which will 
be discussed in greater detail along with information on the Chinese calendar 
in a later unit. For now, they will be used in much the same way that, in English, 
Roman numerals or letters of the alphabet are used to mark subsections of a 
text, or turns in a dialogue. The ﬁ rst four or ﬁ ve of the ten are much more 
common than the others, simply because they occur early in the sequence. 
(Chinese people will be impressed if you can recite all ten!)

1.4 Stative verbs
The verb is the heart of the Chinese sentence. Young urban speakers of Chinese 
may slip material from English or other languages into the noun position in a 
sentence (Woˇ yoˇu lab. ‘I have a lab.’), and nouns with foreign origins, such as 
jítā ‘guitar’, have been incorporated into the language as a result of persistent 
contact with other cultures. Very rarely, however, does a foreign language inﬂ u-
ence the verb position in Chinese.
Some comparisons with English also reveal the centrality of the verb to the 
Chinese sentence scheme. In Chinese, where the context makes the partici-
pants clear, verbs do not need to be anchored with pronouns, as they do in 
English.

Jiaˇ:
Máng ma?
‘Are [you] busy?’
Yıˇ : 
Hěn máng. 
‘[Yes, I] am.’
In English, ‘am’ is not a possible response to the question ‘Are you busy?’ 
A pronoun is required, such as, ‘I am.’ However, in the English answer, the 
verb ‘to be busy’ does not need to be repeated: ‘I am’ rather than ‘I am busy.’ 
Chinese behaves oppositely from English, as our example shows. Pronouns are 
often not expressed when the context makes the reference clear. On the other 
hand, verbs tend to be reiterated in the answer. Moreover, in Chinese, there is 
no need to anticipate the verb with a conﬁ rmation (‘yes’) or denial (‘no’): Shūfu 
ma?/Hěn shūfu. ‘Are you comfortable?’/‘Yes, I am.’
1.4.1 Types of verbs
As you encounter words in Chinese, you will ﬁ nd that it is useful to categorize 
them into groups and subgroups (traditional parts of speech and their sub-
classes), such as nouns (including subtypes such as countable and non-
countable), verbs (including subtypes such as transitive and intransitive), 
pronouns (including personal and demonstrative), and adverbs (including 
those of manner and degree). Such categories capture useful generalizations 
about how words behave. An adverb, for example, will always appear before a 
verb (or other adverb).
It is also useful to be able to talk about the components of a sentence: sub-

Hěn máng would be simply a predicate consisting of an adverb (hěn) and a verb

For Chinese verbs, it will be useful to distinguish a number of classes. In 
this lesson, we will focus on two. One resembles adjectives in English and many 
other languages: haˇo ‘be good’, máng ‘be busy’, è ‘be hungry’. As the English 
glosses show, these words do not require an additional form of the verb ‘to be’ 
(‘are, am, is’, etc.) when they are used as predicates in Chinese: Lèi ma?/Hěn 
lèi. ‘Are [you] tired?’ / ‘[I] am.’ The difference is shown by translating the

Jiaˇ:
Máng ma?
‘Are [you] busy?’
Yıˇ : 
Hěn máng. 
‘[Yes, I] am.’
In English, ‘am’ is not a possible response to the question ‘Are you busy?’ 
A pronoun is required, such as, ‘I am.’ However, in the English answer, the 
verb ‘to be busy’ does not need to be repeated: ‘I am’ rather than ‘I am busy.’ 
Chinese behaves oppositely from English, as our example shows. Pronouns are 
often not expressed when the context makes the reference clear. On the other 
hand, verbs tend to be reiterated in the answer. Moreover, in Chinese, there is 
no need to anticipate the verb with a conﬁ rmation (‘yes’) or denial (‘no’): Shūfu 
ma?/Hěn shūfu. ‘Are you comfortable?’/‘Yes, I am.’
1.4.1 Types of verbs
As you encounter words in Chinese, you will ﬁ nd that it is useful to categorize 
them into groups and subgroups (traditional parts of speech and their sub-
classes), such as nouns (including subtypes such as countable and non-
countable), verbs (including subtypes such as transitive and intransitive), 
pronouns (including personal and demonstrative), and adverbs (including 
those of manner and degree). Such categories capture useful generalizations 
about how words behave. An adverb, for example, will always appear before a 
verb (or other adverb).
It is also useful to be able to talk about the components of a sentence: sub-
jects, predicates, adverbials, modiﬁ ers, etc. A general schema for the sentence 
Hěn máng would be simply a predicate consisting of an adverb (hěn) and a verb 
(máng). It is not necessary to be adept at using the linguistic nomenclature, but 
it is useful to be able to understand the notion of classes of words and positions 
within sentence structure so that generalizations can be noted.

this lesson, we will focus on two. One resembles adjectives in English and many 
other languages: haˇo ‘be good’, máng ‘be busy’, è ‘be hungry’. As the English 
glosses show, these words do not require an additional form of the verb ‘to be’ 
(‘are, am, is’, etc.) when they are used as predicates in Chinese: Lèi ma?/Hěn 
lèi. ‘Are [you] tired?’ / ‘[I] am.’ The difference is shown by translating the

T H E C O R E U N I T S
Chinese words as ‘be+tired’, ‘be+good’, etc. Because such words convey states 
rather than actions, they are called ‘stative verbs’, abbreviated as SV. Strictly 
speaking, SVs should always be glossed as ‘be+adjective’ (when they function 
as predicates), but once the notion is familiar, we will often fall back on the 
more convenient practice of glossing them with English adjectives: máng ‘busy’; 
shūfu ‘comfortable’.
Another general class of verbs involves actions: chī ‘to eat’; xıˇ ‘to wash’; zoˇu 
‘to walk; leave’. These will simply be called action verbs, abbreviated Vact.
1.4.2 Questions and positive responses
You can begin by learning to ask questions with SVs and to give either positive 
or negative responses. Assuming that the context makes explicit (subject) pro-
nouns unnecessary, then one way to ask ‘yes/no’ questions is to add the ﬁ nal 
question particle ma to the proposal.
Haˇo ma? 
‘Are [you] well?’
Máng ma? 
‘Is [she] busy?’
Lèi ma? 
‘Are [you] tired?’
È ma? 
‘Is [he] hungry?’
Kě ma? 
‘Are [you] thirsty?’
Jıˇnzhāng ma? 
‘Are [they] nervous?’
Shūfu ma? 
‘Are [you] comfortable?’
Lěng ma? 
‘Are [you] cold?’
Rè ma? 
‘Is [it] hot?’
Gāo ma? 
‘Is [she] tall?’
Duì ma? 
‘Is [it] correct?’

c. jˇınzhāng [jeen-j!ahng]; shūfu [sh!oofoo]—! reminds you to raise the tip of your tongue toward

when no other is chosen, is hěn ‘very’. However, in contexts such as these, hěn

does little more than support the positive orientation of the sentence, and so 
is best left untranslated. SVs such as duì ‘correct’, which do not permit gradi-
ents, do not occur with degree adverbs such as hěn.
Máng ma? 
Hĕn máng. ‘[Yes, I] am.’

Gāo ma?

Duì ma? 
Duì. ‘[Yes, it] is.’
Notice that, unlike English, where the typical positive answer indicates afﬁ r-
mation with ‘yes’ before going on to answer the question, Mandarin has only 
the direct answer.
1.4.3 Negative responses
Negative responses are usually formed with bù ‘not the case’. Recall that the 
tone is conditioned by that of the following syllable.
Máng ma? 
Bù máng. ‘[No, I]’m not.’
Kě ma? 
Bù kě. ‘[No, I]’m not.’
Gāo ma? 
Bù gāo. ‘[No, she]’s not.’
Duì ma? 
Bú duì. ‘[No, it]’s not.’
As with positive answers, Chinese has no direct equivalent to ‘no’, but simply 
offers a negated verb.
A less abrupt negative (but, again, not used with duì) is formed with bú (with 
tone shift) plus tài ‘too; very’.
Haˇo ma? 
Bú tài haˇo. ‘[No,] not very.’
Máng ma? 
Bú tài máng. ‘[No,] not too.’
Lèi ma? 
Bú tài lèi.
È ma? 
Bú tài è.
NOTE
Negative questions with ma, such as Nıˇ bú lèi ma? ‘Aren’t you tired?’, will be 
dealt with in a later unit. While such questions are easy to form in Chinese, 
the responses follow patterns unfamiliar to speakers of English.

1.4.4 V-not-V questions
Another way to form ‘yes/no’ questions is to present the verb and its negative, 
as though offering both options. The negative, bu, in these constructions is 
often toneless in normal speech, for example: haˇo bù haˇo is usually pronounced 
haˇo bu haˇo, or even haˇo bu hao. While V-ma questions slightly presuppose an 
answer congruent with the question, that is, positive for positive questions, 
negative for negative questions, V-not-V questions are neutral. At this stage, 
you can regard the two as essentially equivalent.

NOTE
With two-syllable SVs, the second syllable of the ﬁ rst, positive part of V-not-V questions often 
gets elided, as indicated by   in the last two examples.
1.4.5 Three degrees of response
You can respond to the two kinds of ‘yes/no’ questions positively, neutrally, or 
negatively. The typical neutral response makes use of the adverb hái (or, before 
other adverbs, háishi) ‘still; yet’: hái haˇo ‘so-so; [I]’m okay (still okay)’.

1.5 Time and tense
1.5.1 Today, yesterday, and tomorrow
Speakers of English and other European languages take the verbal category of 
tense for granted: speaking of the past generally requires the past tense. For 
Chinese (as well as many other languages), this is not so. Time words, such as 
jīntiān ‘today’, zuótiān ‘yesterday’ (both of which share the root tiān ‘sky; day’), 
or dates, may be added to simple sentences containing SVs without any change 
to the form of the verb, or any other addition to the sentence.

The appearance of a time word such as míngtiān ‘tomorrow’ (or a date) can 
be sufﬁ cient to indicate that an event is certain to occur in the future—some-
thing that is also true of English.
Woˇ míngtiān hěn máng.   ‘I’m busy tomorrow.’
However, at times, Chinese does require some additional acknowledgment 
of the fact that, unlike the past and present, the future is uncertain. Thus, in 
talking about future weather, the word huì ‘can; will; likely to’ is, in many cases, 
added to the statement of futurity: Míngtiān huì hěn lěng ma? / Míngtiān bú huì 
tài lěng. ‘Will [it] be cold tomorrow?’ / ‘No, tomorrow won’t be that cold.’ Huì, 
while it does correspond to the English ‘will’ in this example, is not actually as 
common as the latter. For the time being, you should be cautious about talking 
about future states.
1.5.2 Le: small word, big role
Rather than the static notion of past versus present (or, more accurately, past 
versus non-past), Chinese is more sensitive to a dynamic notion of ‘phase’ or 
‘change’. For example, if a speaker wishes to underscore the relevance of a new 
situation, he or she can signal it by the addition of the sentence-ﬁ nal particle le.
Zuótiān bù shūfu, jīntiān hăo le.   ‘[I] didn’t feel well yesterday, but 
 [I]’m better today.’
In this case, the English has no word that can be said to correspond to the 
Chinese le. In other contexts, however, the sense of le might be conveyed by 
the use of words such as ‘become’, ‘now’, or ‘[not] anymore’.
An explicit contrast between an earlier situation (zuótiān) and a current one 
(jīntiān) typically triggers this use of le. But it is also possible to state the situ-
ation before and after without underscoring the change with a ﬁ nal le.
Zuótiān hěn lěng, jīntiān hěn rè.   ‘Yesterday was cold; today’s quite 
 hot.’
Unlike tense in English, which appears under conditions that can be explic-
itly stated (including ‘time before the time of speaking’), ‘change of state’ is

more a question of interpretation. Sometimes the change will loom large in 
the mind of the speaker (or writer); sometimes it will not. Even notions such 
as ‘change of state’ or ‘new situation’ are only partial views of the overall 
function of le in Mandarin discourse. In §1.7.2 below, for example, you will 
see that, with Vact, le takes on a different complexion. Eventually, you will gain 
some insight into how the different functions of le relate, but at this point, 
it is best to proceed incrementally, distinguishing functions as they are 
encountered.

NOTE
Observe that it is the new situation that is associated with le, not the original state. The presence 
of le generally cancels out the need for a supporting adverb, such as hěn.
1.6 Pronouns
As many of the examples above show, Chinese often manages to keep track of 
people (or things) relevant to a situation without the use of pronouns. However, 
pronouns are available where context alone might be insufﬁ cient, or where it 
might otherwise be more appropriate to use one. The set of personal pronouns 
in Chinese is relatively simple and regular. They are presented in the following 
table, with notes following.

NOTES
a. Tā tends to refer to people (or to animals being treated as if they were people) rather than 
to things. On those occasions when tā is used to refer to things, it is more common in object 
position, so it is more likely to occur in the Chinese equivalent of the sentence ‘put it away’ 
than in ‘it’s in the drawer’. Chinese sometimes uses a demonstrative (zhè ‘this’ or nà ‘that’) 
where English has ‘it’, but it often has no explicit correspondence at all.

b. The form nínmen (‘you+POL-MEN’) is rare, but does sometimes occur in letters or formal 
speech. The -men sufﬁ x (not usually toned, though sometimes cited in isolation with a rising 
tone) is most often found with pronouns, as shown. With nouns designating people, it can 
also occur as a ‘collective’: laˇ oshī ‘teacher’, laˇ oshīmen ‘teachers’. Even in such cases, -men should 
not be thought of as a plural marker, for it never combines with numerals: sān ge laˇ oshī ‘three 
teachers’.
c. Mandarin speakers from Beijing and the northeast also make a distinction (found in many 
languages) between woˇ men ‘we’ (that collectively includes the speaker, addressee, and others) 
and zán or zánmen (pronounced ‘zámen’, as if without the ﬁ rst ‘n’) ‘the two of us; we’. The 
latter includes the speaker and the person spoken to, but excludes others. For example: Zánmen 
zoˇ u ba! ‘Let’s leave [us, but not the others]’, a phrase worth storing away as a prototype example 
for zánmen.
1.6.1 Names
Where the identiﬁ cation or status of a person requires more than a pronoun, 
Chinese has recourse to personal names or names and titles (cf. §1.9.1). Chinese 
students often refer to each other either by personal name (at least two sylla-
bles), or by surname (xìng) preﬁ xed by a syllable such as xiaˇo ‘young’. Thus, 
Liú Guózhèng may be addressed by friends as Guózhèng or xiaˇo Liú; Lıˇ Dān, as 
Lıˇ Dān (full name of two syllables) or xiaˇo Lıˇ.
1.6.2 The particle ne and the adverb yě
The particle ne, placed after subject nouns, has a number of uses. It may signal 
a pause for reﬂ ection, something particularly useful for learners.
Zuótiān ne, zuótiān hĕn rè. 
‘Yesterday  .  .  .  yesterday was hot.’
Tā ne, tā hĕn jĭnzhāng. 
‘[As for] him, he’s quite anxious.’
The particle may also be used to signal follow-up questions. The response to 
a follow-up question often contains the adverb yĕ ‘also; too; as well’. Recall that 
adverbs are placed before verbs (including SVs) or other adverbs (such as bu).

1.7 Action verbs
While SVs attribute emotional or physical states to people or things, action 
verbs (Vact ) involve actions, such as eating or going to class. Vact are often sub-
divided into ‘transitive’, those that generally presuppose an object (‘read → a 
book’; ‘eat → a meal’); and ‘intransitive’, those that do not presuppose an object 
(‘walk’; ‘kneel’). However, languages differ as to how this distinction is actually 
realized. In English, for example, when the verb ‘to eat’ means ‘to eat a meal’, 
there is the option of either not expressing an object (‘When do we eat?’), or 
using the generic noun ‘meal’ (‘We had a meal earlier’).
Chinese adopts a different strategy. In comparable sentences, rather than 
not mentioning an object for lack of a particular one, Chinese provides a 
generic object like ‘meal’: chīfàn ‘to eat; to have a meal’. The core meaning of 
fàn is ‘cooked rice’, but in conjunction with chī, it implies ‘food’ or ‘meal’. When 
a particular kind of food is mentioned, fàn is replaced by speciﬁ c words: chī 
miàn ‘to eat noodles’; chī báifàn ‘to eat [white] rice’; chī bāozi ‘to eat dumplings’; 
chī zaˇodiaˇn ‘to eat breakfast’, etc.
Another case in which Chinese provides a generic object, where English has 
either an intransitive verb or one of a number of speciﬁ c options, is xıˇzaˇo ‘to 
bathe; to take a bath/shower’. Xıˇzaˇo is composed of the verb xıˇ ‘to wash’ and 
zaˇo, an element that no longer has independent status, but is treated like an 
object. While English uses an intransitive verb ‘to bathe’ or a speciﬁ c object ‘to 
take a bath’, Chinese provides a generic object, zaˇo. When a speciﬁ c object is 
 10. Tell her that you’re okay today, but you were quite nervous before.

such cases, the negation is formed with the negative of the verb yoˇu ‘to have; 
to exist’. This is méiyoˇu, or simply méi. (Yoˇu is the one verb in Mandarin whose 
negative is not formed with bù—the one irregular verb, you could say.)

‘[She] didn’t go to work; [she] hasn’t started work.’
Since the action verbs introduced in this lesson involve events that can be 
expected to take place regularly over the course of the day, the adverb hái (or 
háishi before other adverbs) ‘still; yet’ is common in negative answers. Hái shi 
is frequently accompanied by the sentence-ﬁ nal particle ne, which generally 
conveys a tone of immediacy or suspense (as well as being associated with 
follow-up questions, cf. §1.6.2).
Hái méi chīfàn ne.

1.7.2 Vact with le
Vact may also appear with le. As noted in §1.5.2, le with SVs signals a change of 
state, or a newly relevant state: jīntiān haˇo le. With Vact,  the function of le is 
more diffuse, or at least it seems so from a learner’s perspective. Le with Vact, 
much as it does with SVs, may signal a newly relevant situation or phase. But 
with Vact, the initiation or conclusion of the action may be of relevance.
Initiation:
Zoˇu le. 
‘[They]’re off.’
Chīfàn le. 
‘[They]’ve started [eating].’
Shàngkè le. 
‘Class is starting.’
Conclusion:

‘Conclusion’ may seem like another way of saying ‘past tense’, but there are 
reasons for avoiding any identiﬁ cation of le with [past] tense. You have already 
seen that, with SVs, the past situation is not that which is marked with le, but 
the current one: Zuótiān bù shūfu, jīntiān haˇo le. You will also see many other 
cases where past tense in English does not correspond to the presence of le in 
Chinese. More to the point: injecting the notion of past tense into our descrip-
tion of le suggests a static function quite at odds with that other, well-
established dynamic function of le, to signal a particular relevance of an event 
to the current discourse—the story line that is being advanced.
For the time being, then, note that le has two faces: it signals the current 
relevancy of a new state or situation (in this case, le can appear with the nega-
tive bù).
Lěng le. 
‘[It]’s gotten cold.’
Bù lěng le. 
‘[It]’s not cold anymore.’
Bù chī le. 
‘[They]’re not eating anymore.’
The particle le can also signal the current relevance of a completed event (in 
which case it is negated by méi yŏu).
Shàngkè le. 
‘Class is beginning; [they]’ve gone 
 
 to class.’
Hái méiyŏu shàngkè ne. 
‘[They] haven’t gone to class yet.’
Confusion about the several senses of le with Vact can often be resolved by 
the addition of an adverb, such as yıˇjīng ‘already’.
Tāmen yıˇ jīng zoˇu le. 
‘They’ve already left.’
Woˇ yıˇ jīng chīfàn le. 
‘I’ve already eaten.’
Yıˇ jīng xiàbān le. 
‘[He]’s already quit [for the day].’
1.7.3 Questions
Actions can be questioned with the question particle ma.
Chīfàn le ma? 
‘Have [you] eaten [a meal]?’
Xıˇ zaˇo le ma? 
‘Have [you] bathed?’
Shàngbān le ma? 
‘Has [she] started work?’

Confusion about the several senses of le with Vact can often be resolved by 
the addition of an adverb, such as yıˇjīng ‘already’.
Tāmen yıˇ jīng zoˇu le. 
‘They’ve already left.’
Woˇ yıˇ jīng chīfàn le. 
‘I’ve already eaten.’

1.8 Conventional greetings
1.8.1 The addition of guò (untoned)
Questions about eating are often used ‘phatically’, to be sociable rather than to 
seek actual information. There are a number of variants on the basic Chīfàn le 
ma that may serve this purpose. A particularly common variation used with 
verbs that describe regularly occurring events (such as having meals and going 
to work) involves the addition of a post-verbal guò (usually untoned), whose 
root meaning is ‘to pass by, over, through’. Guò can occur in both the question 
and in responses (positive and negative), but it can also be dropped from the 
responses, as demonstrated below.

1.9 Greeting and taking leave
1.9.1 Names and titles
Because even perfunctory greetings tend to involve a name and title, you need 
to have some rudimentary information about forms of address before being 
introduced to the language of greeting and leave taking. Below are ﬁ ve common 
Chinese surnames, followed by a title which means, literally, ‘teacher’, and the 
SV haˇo, which in this context serves as a simple acknowledgment. Laˇoshī, which 
has no exact correspondence in English, can be applied to both males and 
females, as well as to all ranks of teachers.
Zhāng laˇoshī haˇo. 
‘Hello, Professor Zhang.’
Wáng lăoshī hăo.
Lĭ lăoshī hăo.

Zhào lăoshī hăo.
Chén lăoshī hăo.
1.9.2 Hello
Using specialized greetings such as ‘hi’ or bonjour to acknowledge or conﬁ rm 
the value of a relationship on every encounter is not a universal feature of cul-
tures. The practice seems to have crept into Chinese relatively recently. Whereas 
in the past, people might have acknowledged your presence by asking where 
you were going or if you had eaten (that is, if they said anything at all to a 
stranger), urban Chinese today often make use of phrases like nıˇ haˇo in ways 
similar to English ‘hi’ or ‘hello’. Most people would probably regard nıˇ haˇo as 
the prototypical neutral greeting, but other options are listed below.
Nıˇ  haˇo!
‘Hi! Hello!’
Nín haˇo!

‘How do you do?’
Hei!

A version of ‘good morning’, based on the verb zaˇo (‘be+early’), has been in 
common usage in Taiwan for some time and is now becoming more common 
on the Mainland as well.
Zaˇo! 
‘Morning!’ (‘be+early’)
Zaˇo ān. 
‘Good morning.’ (‘early peace’)
Nıˇ zaˇo.
Nín zaˇo.
Expressions comparable to English ‘good afternoon’ or ‘good evening’ are 
also starting to be used in modern China. Thus, xiàwuˇ  ‘afternoon’ and waˇnshàng 
‘evening’ are used in the expressions xiàwuˇ  haˇo ‘good afternoon’ and waˇnshàng 
haˇo ‘good evening’. Waˇn ān ‘good night’ (‘late peace’), used as a sign-off at the 
end of the day, has a longer pedigree and is now commonly used by staff in 
larger hotels, for example.
In general, greetings of the sort listed above are used more sparingly than 
their English counterparts. Colleagues or classmates passing each other, for 
example, are less likely to use a formulaic greeting such as nıˇ haˇo, though rela-
tive cultural novelties such as fast food restaurants and toll booths may encour-
age broader use. In general, though, a greeting to someone of higher status 
should be preceded by a name, or a name and title (as in §1.9.1).
1.9.3 Good-bye
Many cultures have conventional phrases for taking leave. Often, blessings 
serve this purpose (e.g., ‘bye’, from ‘good-bye’, supposedly derived from the 
phrase ‘God be with you’). Below are several Chinese variations of ‘good-bye’, 
beginning with the standard, zàijiàn (‘again-see’).

a. The addition of ﬁ nal r to a written pinyin syllable represents a complex series of phonetic 
effects that will be considered more fully later. In the case of yìhuˇır ∼ yíhuìr, the ﬁ nal r affects 
the quality of the preceding vowel, so that it is pronounced ‘yìhuĕr ∼ yíhuèr’ rather than ‘yìhuˇır 
∼ yíhuìr’. The usual prescription applies: listen to your teacher or to the audio.
b. The alternate pronunciation yíhuìr may be more common in dialects found in southern 
China.
c. Students and other urban youth of all kinds often end a series of farewells with the English-
inﬂ uenced expression baibai.
d. As with greetings, when saying good-bye to an older person or a person of rank, it is normal 
to mention name and title ﬁ rst, e.g., Wèi laˇ oshī, zàijiàn.
1.9.4 Bon voyage
This is a good time to familiarize yourself with a few phrases that are used to 
wish people well when they leave on a journey, or to greet them when they 
arrive. The most common expression for bon voyage is:
Yílù-píng’ān.   (‘Whole-journey peaceful.’)
This expression applies to almost any journey, whether by air, ship, or bus. 
Yílù-shùnfēng (‘whole-journey favorable-wind’) has much the same meaning, 
but it is not used for journeys by air. Chinese people are generally superstitious 
about the effect of words, and many would usually deem it ill-advised to 
mention the word fēng ‘wind’ before a ﬂ ight. Notice that both expressions 
contain four syllables, a favored conﬁ guration in the Chinese lexicon.
In greeting someone returning from a long journey, instead of the question 
‘How was the ﬂ ight/journey/voyage?’, Chinese people generally utter a variant 
of an expression that reﬂ ects the traditional discomforts of travel.
Lù shàng xīnkuˇ  ba?  ‘Tough journey, huh?’ (‘road on bitter BA’)

arrive. The most common expression for bon voyage is:
Yílù-píng’ān.   (‘Whole-journey peaceful.’)
This expression applies to almost any journey, whether by air, ship, or bus. 
Yílù-shùnfēng (‘whole-journey favorable-wind’) has much the same meaning, 
but it is not used for journeys by air. Chinese people are generally superstitious 
about the effect of words, and many would usually deem it ill-advised to 
mention the word fēng ‘wind’ before a ﬂ ight. Notice that both expressions 
contain four syllables, a favored conﬁ guration in the Chinese lexicon.
In greeting someone returning from a long journey, instead of the question 
‘How was the ﬂ ight/journey/voyage?’, Chinese people generally utter a variant 
of an expression that reﬂ ects the traditional discomforts of travel.
Lù shàng xīnkuˇ  ba?  ‘Tough journey, huh?’ (‘road on bitter BA’)

An analysis of these expressions is provided above, but at this stage, they 
should simply be memorized (by repetition) and kept in storage for greeting 
visitors or seeing people off.
Yílù-píng’ān!
1.9.5 Smoothing the transitions
A. PRIOR TO ASKING A QUESTION In more formal situations, questions are often 
prefaced with the expression qıˇ ngwèn (‘request-ask’), idiomatically equivalent to 
‘may I ask’ or ‘excuse me’. Qıˇ ngwèn may also be preceded by a name and title.
Qıˇ ngwèn, nıˇ chīfàn le ma? 
‘Excuse me, have you eaten?’
Zhào laˇoshī, qıˇ ngwèn, nín è bu è? 
‘Professor Zhao, mind if I ask: 
 
 are you hungry?’
Qıˇ ng ‘request; invite’ also occurs in the common phrase qıˇ ng zuò ‘have a seat’ 
(‘invite sit’) and the expression qıˇ ng jìn ‘won’t you come in’ (‘invite enter’).

B. PRIOR TO LEAVING In the normal course of events, a simple good-bye is often 
too abrupt for closing a conversation. One way to smooth the transition is to 
announce that you have to leave before you say good-bye. Here are four ways 
to accomplish this, all involving the verb zoˇu ‘to leave; to go’. These expressions 
are complicated to analyze; some notes are provided below, but otherwise, they 
should be internalized as units.
Haˇo, nà woˇ zoˇu le. 
‘Okay, I’m off then.’ (‘okay, in+that+case, I 
 
 leave LE’)
Hei, woˇ gāi zoˇu le. 
‘Say, I should be off.’ (‘hey, I should leave LE’)
Haˇo, nà jiù zhè 
‘Okay then, that’s it, [I]’m off!’ (‘okay, in+that+
 yàng ba, zoˇu le. 
 case, then this-way BA, leave LE’)
Bù zaˇo le, woˇ gāi 
‘[It]’s late, I’d better be off.’ (‘not be+early LE,
 zoˇu le. 
 I should leave LE’)
NOTES
a. gāi / yīnggāi ‘should; must’; nà ‘in that case; well; then’; jiù ‘then’; ba (particle associated 
with suggestions); le ([here] signals a new situation)
b. Taking leave obviously involves a broad range of situations, including seeing someone off 
on a journey (which, in China, is an extremely important event). The four options included in 
this section are acceptable for closing an informal conversation.
1.10 Tones
1.10.1 Tone combos (the ﬁ rst six)
Tones are easier to perceive and assimilate in pairs. Four tones form sixteen 
possible combinations of two, but because of the previously discussed restric-
tion on combinations of low tones (3 + 3 = 2 + 3), only ﬁ fteen pairs are distinc-
tive. The six sets below are mostly comprised of words you have already 
encountered. They should be memorized so that they can be recited by number 
(typically as part of warm-up activities at the beginning of class): dì-yī: laˇoshī, 
jıˇnzhāng; dì-èr: xıˇzaˇo, hěn haˇo, etc.

Tones in combination tend to accommodate each other to some degree, 
though not to the point of shifting to another tone. In the above sets, the most 
salient adjustment is probably that of 4 + 4 (zàijiàn), where the tone of the ﬁ rst 
syllable is not as steeply falling as that of the last. The ﬁ rst of the two is some-
times referred to as the ‘modiﬁ ed fourth tone’.
1.10.2 Tone lock
In these ﬁ rst weeks of learning Chinese, you may ﬁ nd yourself unable to pro-
nounce a tone, even unable to mimic your teacher—a situation that might be 
called ‘tone lock’. Tone lock can occur for many reasons, but a common one 
for beginners is that you will often be tentative, and tentativeness in English is 
accompanied by a rising contour. This is ﬁ ne if you are trying to say a name, 
such as Wáng, with rising tone. However, it won’t work if you want to say Wèi, 
with a falling tone. Other frustrating conditions may occur: you may hear rising 
as falling, and falling as rising (ﬂ ip-ﬂ op); your falling tone may refuse to fall 
(‘fear of falling’), your level tone may refuse not to fall (‘fear of ﬂ ying’). Regard-
less of the symptoms, the best cure is to take a ﬁ gurative step back and make 
use of your tone concepts: level is ‘sung out’, rising is ‘doubtful’, low is ‘low’ 
(despite the contoured symbol), and falling is ‘ﬁ nal’ or ‘conﬁ dent’.
1.10.3 The ﬁ rst ‘rule of three’
If you ﬁ nd that the tonal cues, ‘sung out’, ‘doubt’, ‘low’, and ‘ﬁ nal’ do not serve 
you well, there are others that have been used in the past. Walter C. Hillier, in 
his 1953 English-Chinese Dictionary (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul Ltd.), 
proposed ‘languid assertion’ for the ﬁ rst tone, ‘startled surprise’ for the second,

This is the ﬁ rst of the character lessons, in which you are introduced to the 
Chinese writing system, the form and function of characters, the principles 
of handwriting, the approach to reading adopted by Learning Chinese, and the 
characters for numbers, dates, surnames, pronouns, verbs, and enough 
function words to allow for some readable content. This lesson presupposes 
familiarity with the material in at least Unit 1.

8.1.1 Size
Regardless of complexity, characters are uniform in overall size, ﬁ tting into an 
imaginary rectangle along the lines indicated in the following example (written 
with simpliﬁ ed characters). For this reason, characters are also called fāngkuàizì 
‘squared writing’.

words rather than syllables. Characters, however, are evenly spaced, regardless 
of word boundaries.
8.1.3 Punctuation
Modern Chinese writing makes use of punctuation conventions that are similar 
in form to those of English, though not always identical in function.
Periods, full stops: 
Ą/ .
The former is traditionally used, but the latter 
 is becoming more common.
Commas: 
, / ă
The latter is commonly used in lists separating 
 enumerated items.
Quotes: 
Ķ!/!/!/!ķ0!‘ . . . ’ / “ . . . ”
The ﬁ rst type is traditionally used, but the 
 others are also common.
Proper names: 
There is nothing comparable to a capital letter 
 in Chinese. Proper names are usually 
 unmarked, though, occasionally, they are 
 indicated by a wavy underline.
Other punctuation will be noted as it is encountered.
8.1.4 Direction
Traditionally, Chinese has been written and read from top to bottom and from 
right to left. Major writing reforms instituted in the PRC during the 1950s not 
only formalized a set of simpliﬁ ed characters, but required them to be written 
horizontally, from left to right, like modern European languages. As a result, 
Chinese texts now come in two basic formats. Material originating in Taiwan 
and traditional overseas communities, or on the Mainland prior to the reforms, 
is written with traditional characters that are, with a few exceptions such as in 
headlines and on forms, arranged in vertical columns and read from right to

communities subsequent to the reforms of the 1950s is written with simpliﬁ ed 
characters arranged in horizontal rows and read from left to right, just like 
English and countless other languages.
A number of other writing systems originally adopted the Chinese conven-
tion of vertical writing, though most of these have also since shifted to a pri-
marily horizontal conﬁ guration. Japanese writing remains vertical for the most 
part. Korean shifted to mostly horizontal a few decades ago. The Classical 
Mongolian script, still seen on some of the buildings in the National Palace 
Museum in Beijing and elsewhere, was written vertically on the Chinese 
model, but with columns moving left to right, not right to left. Nowadays, 
Mongolian is mostly written in the Cyrillic (Russian) script, horizontally and 
left to right.
8.2 The form of characters
Characters are the primary unit for writing Chinese. Just as English letters 
have several forms (such as g/g and a/a) and styles (such as italic and bold), 
Chinese characters also have various realizations. Some styles that developed 
in early historical periods survive to this day in special functions. For example, 
the Chinese traditionally use ink impressions made by seals or ‘chops’, 
mostly square-shaped and made from various types of stone, in lieu of signa-
tures on documents and items of value. The names and other characters on 
such seals are usually, even now, inscribed in a version of the character script 
known as the ‘seal script’ (zhuànshū), ﬁ rst developed during the Qin dynasty 
(3rd century BCE). Other scripts include the ‘grass script’ (caˇ oshū) and the 
‘running script’ (xíngshū), impressionistic versions of the standard script that 
are still used in handwriting and art. As in other scripts, advertisers and 
designers may also modify the look of characters in a variety of different 
ways for their own purposes. Putting such variants aside, it is estimated that 
the number of distinct characters appearing in modern texts is between 6,000 
and 7,000. Fortunately, about half that number will sufﬁ ce to read most

modern material, such as newspapers, academic writing, and popular novels. 
High total numbers of characters are to be found in the most comprehensive 
dictionaries, but these numbers are inﬂ ated by archaic characters and 
variants.
8.2.1 Radicals and phonetics
There are certain ameliorating factors that make the Chinese writing system 
more learnable than it might otherwise seem to be. One of the most signiﬁ cant 
is the fact that many characters have common constituents. Between two-thirds 
and three-quarters of common characters (cf. DeFrancis 1984, p. 110 and 
passim) consist of two elements, both of which can often also stand alone as 
characters in their own right. Historically, these elements were selected either 
for their sounds (hence the term ‘phonetic elements’, or simply ‘phonetics’), 
or for their meanings (making them semantic elements, commonly called 
‘radicals’). Thus, Ԟ wàng ‘to forget’ contains ˸ wáng as a phonetic element 
and ͕!‘heart’ as a radical; ᄬ yuˇ  ‘language’ is composed of Ӎ wú and ֏!
‘language’. The signiﬁ cance of phonetics and radicals will be discussed 
in a later section. For now, it is enough to know that a few hundred simple 
graphs are the building blocks for a large number of compound graphs: for 
example, ˸ appears in ѓ and ڣ; ͕ in Ԡ and م; ֏ in ᔁ and ᄲ; Ӎ in ु 
and ୏. These ‘root’ graphs number in the high hundreds, and familiarity 
with them allows many characters to be learned as a pairing of higher-order 
constituents (such as ᒦ + ቦ*- rather than just a complex composite of 
strokes (ᒨ).
8.2.2 Simpliﬁ ed characters
As noted in the introduction, Chinese policy makers tried to make the writing 
system easier to learn by introducing the Chinese equivalent of spelling reform, 
i.e., reducing the number of strokes in complicated characters. Thus, ઼ 
becomes ਪ and ᙝ becomes ܟ, with the simpliﬁ ed version generally modeled 
on variants that had long been current in handwriting or calligraphy, but 
not in print. The two sets of characters are usually referred to in English as

‘traditional’ and ‘simpliﬁ ed’, and in Chinese as fántıˇ zì (‘complicated-body-
characters’) and jiaˇ ntıˇ zì (‘simple-body-characters’).
For you, the learner, this simpliﬁ cation is a mixed blessing; while it ostensi-
bly made writing characters simpler, it also made characters less redundant for 
reading. For example, ሄ and ڌ (‘music’ and ‘east’, respectively) are quite 
distinct as traditional characters, but their simpliﬁ ed versions—ಘ and ࣁ—are 
easier to confuse.
As noted in the Introduction, jiaˇ ntıˇ zì and fántıˇ zì should not be thought of as 
two distinct writing systems; many characters retain only one form (ጐ yeˇ , ੪ 
heˇ n, ੑ haˇ o), and of those that have two forms, the vast majority exhibit only 
minor differences: ႁ / ᄲ, भ / ฺ/ There are perhaps only three dozen relatively 
common characters with quite divergent forms, such as ᑚ / ఺ and ൰ / ෴. 
Careful inspection reveals that even these characters often have elements in 
common. For native Chinese readers, the two systems represent only a minor 
inconvenience, on par with the discrepancies between capital and lowercase 
letters in the Roman alphabet (though, admittedly, on a larger scale). Generally, 
learners focus on one system for writing, but soon get used to reading in both. 
In this text, both sets are introduced, but most of the readings are based on the 
simpliﬁ ed set that is standard for the 1.3 billion people on the Mainland. In 
most major sections of the character lessons, there is at least one sample text 
or exercise written in traditional characters.
8.3 The function of characters
As noted in the Introduction, Chinese uses a system of writing that employs 
complex symbols (characters) to represent syllables of particular words, or syl-
lables that constitute parts of particular words. For this reason, it is difﬁ cult to 
use Chinese characters to transcribe foreign names: ‘Italy’ can be incorporated 
into Chinese as Yìdàlì and written ຍ̂Ӏ, but the usual meaning of the char-
acters, ‘meaning-be big-beneﬁ t’ can only be dimmed by context, not completely 
suppressed.
In Chinese, different words with identical sounds (homophones) will usually 
be written with different characters.

language word processing with pinyin input, typing ‘shiqing’ and ‘kaoshi’ (most

reading. Reasonable goals at the beginning level are to learn the principles of 
writing so that any character can be reproduced by copying, and to learn to 
write from memory a selection of representative graphs that can serve as the 
basis for future calligraphic endeavors.

There are many good websites that deal with the writing of Chinese characters. 
Some not only present the general principles of writing, but also allow the

Chinese characters without using special graphics or non-text insertions and

visual memory.
A. FORM Characters are usually said to be formed from eight basic strokes, 
but because two of the ‘basic’ strokes’ only appear appended to others (without 
the writing implement being lifted from the surface), they should really be 
regarded as basic components of strokes rather than actual strokes. All eight 
are illustrated below, with the names of each given on the far left. It is useful 
to be able to describe how a character is written by naming its strokes: héng +

a. The stroke xiégōu ‘slant + hook’ is always so called even though nàgōu ‘slanting down to the 
right + hook’ also looks like a reasonable name for it.
b. Sometimes a subcategory of the pieˇ  stroke, duaˇ npieˇ  ‘short + slanting down to the left’, is 
included in the list of basic strokes. Examples would be the top stroke of ໻!or the top-left 
stroke of!ᇍ. Otherwise, these strokes are simply pieˇ .
c. There are in fact some miscellaneous strokes that cannot be usefully analyzed in terms of 
the eight basics, e.g. wāngōu ‘curved + hook’, that appears, for example, on the left-hand side 
of the character ১.
d. It is also quite common to combine three stroke components into a single stroke. The 
bottom stroke of ၗ (shown above) consists of ‘héngzhé + gōu’, i.e. ‘horizontal with bend + 
hook’. In fact, in terms of frequency, bent strokes are more common with a ﬁ nal hook than 
without; cf. ए, ጐ, ࢫ.
B. DIRECTION In most cases, strokes are falling or horizontal, and left to right. 
Only one of the six unitary strokes rises—the one called tí (seen in the 
lower-left strokes of the two sample characters, ࡌ and ੈ); only one ﬂ ows

8.5 Presentation of characters
The reading and writing lessons in Learning Chinese are organized on the 
general principle that characters are best learned by encountering them many 
times in texts rather than in lists. Before characters can be read, however, they 
need to be recognized; and to be recognized, key features need to be noticed. 
In these lessons, characters are introduced in a large size, with information 
about number of strokes, pronunciation, general meaning, and form. This 
information is intended to give the characters some individuality and provide 
traction for the reading process. Sometimes, knowledge about the actual history 
of the character may account for, and therefore help to remember, its form. In 
other cases, the actual history of the character may be less helpful than a fanci-
ful account. The notes that follow the introduction of each set of characters 
contain both actual and fanciful etymologies. Students, in any case, often make 
up their own stories to account for the form of characters. What is important 
is to ﬁ nd a way to link the shape of the character to the word it represents so 
that reading can proceed.

In the later sections of this lesson, and in other lessons, readings begin with 
words and phrases (with pinyin conﬁ rmation), then continue with short inter-
actions, longer dialogues, and, when possible, narratives and stories. Once you 
ﬁ nd that you can read the material with conﬁ dence, you can consolidate by 
learning to write the graphs. Focusing on individual graphs will draw your 
attention to slight differences and prepare you for encountering new 
combinations.
NOTES
a. Since most words in Mandarin are compounds (of two or more syllables), characters gener-
ally represent parts of compounds rather than words as such. Sometimes combinational or 
historical information can suggest a general meaning for a single character in a compound: 
ීᄖ ‘bright’ + ‘day’ for míngtiān ‘tomorrow’. In cases where a particular character has no 
independent existence outside a compound, it may not be possible to give it a reliable meaning: 
ᔦᄖ zuótiān ‘(? + day) yesterday’. (The same problems exists for the English word ‘yesterday’, 
which combines the word ‘day’ with the non-word ‘yester’.) In such cases, if a general meaning 
can be inferred from other combinations, it will be placed in parentheses.
b. For characters with two forms, simpliﬁ ed and traditional, both forms are given, with the 
traditional form above the simpliﬁ ed. The reason for this order is that the simpliﬁ ed generally 
derives from the traditional. Once past the initial introduction, however, the focus is more on 
the simpliﬁ ed set, and when both are cited, simpliﬁ ed precedes traditional.
c. The order and direction of strokes for individual characters are provided in Appendix 1.
d. It is not crucial to know which radical a particular graph is classiﬁ ed under, but it is useful 
to recognize the most common radicals. The system of paired numbers written beneath the 
large-format characters that provide the introduction to each set is a practical way of doing this. 
The ﬁ rst number represents the number of strokes for the character’s radical. The second 
number represents the number of remaining strokes in the character. (Traditionally, Chinese 
dictionaries are organized in this way, ﬁ rst by radical, then by number of strokes.) The sum 
of these two numbers is the total number of strokes for the character. When the second 
number is zero (as for ޠ 4 + 0 / ܜ 8 + 0), the character is itself a radical. In some cases, 
characters that have only one form have been assigned a different radical in the simpliﬁ ed set 
from that of the traditional; for example, ԙ dì ‘younger brother’, for which there is no 
traditional-simpliﬁ ed distinction, is assigned the radical ̕ in the traditional set (3 + 4), but ˣ 
in the simpliﬁ ed set (2 + 5). In such cases, both numbers are given, with the traditional radical 
assignment ﬁ rst.
For the majority of cases, the numbering method makes it clear which element is the radical. 
However, when the radical is obscure, or the number of strokes for the radical happens to

The characters for ‘one’, ‘two’, and ‘three’ are obviously representational. The near left-right 
symmetry of the characters for ‘four’, ‘six’, ‘eight’, and ‘ten’ is not entirely coincidental. ႐ 
seems to have represented a whole easily divided into two parts; an earlier form of ങ looked 
very much like that of ႐ (with the two lower ‘legs’ of ങ matching the two inner strokes of 
႐). ڭ (distinguished from ཽ rén ‘person’ and ྜྷ rù ‘enter’) is also said to have represented 
the notion of division (into two groups of four); and လ represented a unity of the four cardinal 
directions with the center. Smaller multiples of ten are occasionally represented as unit char-
acters, especially where space is at a premium: ᔷ!‘twenty’ and 丗!‘thirty’. However, they are

below illustrate. Note that when the product is only a single digit, the 
rhythm is preserved by adding ଀ dé ‘gets’; for similar reasons, the teens 
are often recited as yīshí’èr, etc., rather than just shí’èr.

Practice reading telephone numbers.
Although telephone numbers are often written out in Arabic numerals 
on business cards, they do appear as characters in other contexts, with the 
exception of líng ‘zero’, which is more often written ‘O’. Practice reading 
the following until you can do so ﬂ uently, with a good rhythm. Recall that, 
in the Mainland, ‘one’ in telephone numbers (as well as in other kinds of 
lists) is usually pronounced yāo rather than yī.

Interestingly, the traditional, ‘lunar calendar’ dates are often written out in 
full, with the numbers also represented by characters. The Chinese lunar cal-
endar consists of 12 months of 29 to 30 days, plus intercalary months inserted 
every few years to make up the difference. The lunar New Year usually begins 
several weeks after the solar New Year. Lunar years are counted in cycles of 
60, which accounts for all possible combinations of a set of 10 ‘stems’ and 12 
‘branches’ (i.e., 1–1, 1–2 . . . 1–11, 1–12, 2–1 . . . 10–12, etc.). Though the ﬁ rst lunar 
month has a special name (zhèngyuè), the rest are all written with number + 
yuè, just like the solar calendar months; rì is usually left out of lunar dates. The 
correspondence is as follows:

a. It is useful to distinguish simplex (non-compound) characters from compound. The latter 
contain parts that can themselves be characters: for example, ځ míng ‘bright’ is composed of 
the two graphs྇!rì ‘sun; day’ and Ꮬyuè ‘moon; month’. While more common characters are 
often simplex, the vast majority are compound. The form of simplex graphs can often be clas-
siﬁ ed as representational and thereby rationalized by a non-linguistic reference (e.g., ྇ origi-
nated as a representation of the sun and Ꮬ of the moon). Graphic elements are compounded, 
however, not to form new representations, but to combine linguistic elements of sound 
(phonetics) and meaning (radicals).
b. ͇ tiān has the root meaning of ‘sky; day’, and it is said to be based on a drawing that rep-
resented the sky above Earth. ځ míng is composed of the characters for ‘sun’ and ‘moon’, and 
appears in compounds with the meaning ‘bright’ (cf. ‘a bright tomorrow’). ߑ zuó is also a 
compound, combining the radical ྇ rì ‘sun’ with the phonetic ᐟ zhà.

a. ᆸ , ฝ, and ඣ/ࣇ, like the other graphs used for pronouns (Ⴧ and ჉) are compound, 
though only one of the parts of ᆸ can still be represented independently in the modern lan-
guage—the right element is the graph ় gē ‘spear’ (looking more like a harpoon with its barbed 
tip down). Both ฝ and ඣ/ࣇ have a left element that is a vertical version of the graph ཽ 
‘person’, known as rénzìpáng ‘person at the side’ (or the ‘person radical’). The right elements, 
ऑ and ඡ/ܝ, respectively, also appear independently (cf. next item).
b. ඣ/ࣇ consists of the person radical plus ඡ/ܝ mén ‘door’, which is phonetic. ඡ/ܝ was 
originally a representation of a door with two leaves.
c. The graph ̙, said to derive from a drawing of a bird, was borrowed to write bù not because 
of its form, but because of similarity of sound. A made-up etymology: ‘̙ represents an arrow 
being shot at the ceiling—but not managing to pass through’.
d. The set in §8.10 is the ﬁ rst to include graphs that have both simpliﬁ ed and traditional forms: 
ඣ/ࣇ and ൮/๜. The simpliﬁ ed graphs are both based on traditional calligraphic forms, and 
they retain a holistic resemblance to the traditional form, even though the two share only a 
few strokes in common.

a. ᆸ , ฝ, and ඣ/ࣇ, like the other graphs used for pronouns (Ⴧ and ჉) are compound, 
though only one of the parts of ᆸ can still be represented independently in the modern lan-
guage—the right element is the graph ় gē ‘spear’ (looking more like a harpoon with its barbed 
tip down). Both ฝ and ඣ/ࣇ have a left element that is a vertical version of the graph ཽ 
‘person’, known as rénzìpáng ‘person at the side’ (or the ‘person radical’). The right elements, 
ऑ and ඡ/ܝ, respectively, also appear independently (cf. next item).
b. ඣ/ࣇ consists of the person radical plus ඡ/ܝ mén ‘door’, which is phonetic. ඡ/ܝ was 
originally a representation of a door with two leaves.
c. The graph ̙, said to derive from a drawing of a bird, was borrowed to write bù not because 
of its form, but because of similarity of sound. A made-up etymology: ‘̙ represents an arrow 
being shot at the ceiling—but not managing to pass through’.
d. The set in §8.10 is the ﬁ rst to include graphs that have both simpliﬁ ed and traditional forms: 
ඣ/ࣇ and ൮/๜. The simpliﬁ ed graphs are both based on traditional calligraphic forms, and 
they retain a holistic resemblance to the traditional form, even though the two share only a 
few strokes in common.

entrance’ (but here suggesting ‘colloquial’) removes any ambiguity. Cf. ൦/๽ mā, the informal

a. SVs: р is composed of the female radical ̃ and ̄ zıˇ  ‘child’ (the latter without a phonetic 
function), often explained as the paradigm of a ‘good relationship’. ௢ includes ϣ tián ‘ﬁ eld’ 
above and the radical derived from the graph for ‘silk’ below: ‘a heavy and tiring burden for 
such a slender base’. ѓ combines the ‘heart radical’ (an elongated and truncated version of 
͕) and ˸ wáng as a phonetic element, and can be compared to Ԟ wàng ‘to forget’ with the 
same elements conﬁ gured vertically. ऌ0ዴ!is composed of the element ᣹/飠, known as the 
‘food radical’, and the phonetic element ᆸ woˇ . ҽ includes two strokes (diaˇ n and tí) on the left, 
forming the so-called ‘ice radical’, found only in a few graphs such as Д bīng ‘ice’. The right 
element of ҽ is ΄ lìng, a phonetic element also found in ࿬ líng ‘zero’. The four strokes at 
the base of ེ/ሤ are a form of the ‘ﬁ re radical’ which, in its independent form, is written ૜.
b. ADVs: The graph ੪ is composed of the radical ᢼ and the phonetic Ᾰ gèn (cf. ੬ hèn, ੫ 
heˇ n, ৌ gēn). ვ is ࡍ dà ‘big’ with an extra diaˇ n. The graph થ/ᔘ is also used for the word 
huán ‘to give back’, which probably accounts for the presence of ᨙ on the left, a radical associ-
ated with motion. The simpliﬁ ed version substitutes ̙ not for its sound or meaning, but for 
its general shape, which serves to represent the complicated right-hand element.
c. ˞should be distinguished from ̄ zıˇ . In the traditional set, the radical assigned to˞ is the 
second stroke, the vertical hook; but in the simpliﬁ ed set, it is the ﬁ rst stroke, whose uncon-
torted form is ˙, a radical also assigned to ˵.

a. ߐ is a compound of ా koˇ u ‘mouth’ and the element ໨, independently pronounced qıˇ .

‘classic texts’ [cf. English ‘text’ and ‘textile’]. The etymological meaning of the compound ̏གྷ 
is harder to see, but probably derives from a notion of ‘to complete the task’.
d. The traditional ՟ has the same number of strokes as ඗ in the simpliﬁ ed set, so they are 
placed together above to save space. Both have the water radical on the left (three strokes, two 
diaˇ n and a tí, in contrast to a diaˇ n plus tí in ದ). In the simpliﬁ ed graph, the right side of the tra-
ditional character has been replaced by the independently occurring element Კ. ඗0՟ is also 
used for the word mò ‘to submerge’, which probably explains the presence of the water radical.
